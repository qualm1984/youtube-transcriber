[0.12s -> 5.32s]  Creatine is probably one of the most well-researched, science-backed supplements that you can take.
[5.40s -> 8.38s]  Creatine is a fuel source for high-intensity activity.
[8.52s -> 10.84s]  How much extra muscle would you build if you took creatine?
[10.96s -> 12.38s]  How to properly use creatine.
[12.48s -> 13.00s]  Creatine.
[13.18s -> 13.70s]  Creatine.
[13.84s -> 14.36s]  Creatine.
[14.54s -> 14.94s]  Creatine.
[15.10s -> 15.50s]  Creatine.
[15.60s -> 16.02s]  Creatine.
[17.34s -> 22.84s]  Today I sit down with Professor Darren Kandell, one of the world's leading scientists studying
[22.84s -> 23.46s]  creatine.
[23.72s -> 28.64s]  This episode brings us up to date with the latest research out of Darren's lab focused
[28.64s -> 35.06s]  on creatine supplementation and bone health, and also serves as a refresher, doubling back
[35.06s -> 40.92s]  over some of the things that Professor Eric Rawson shared with us back in episode 212.
[41.22s -> 45.94s]  Creatine was shown to increase muscle strength, have beneficial effects on muscle mass and
[45.94s -> 49.32s]  lean tissue mass, and of course it improves some tasks of functionality.
[49.88s -> 54.28s]  Those individuals who took creatine before they did the race, they had a huge reduction
[54.28s -> 57.88s]  in the amount of those inflammatory proteins compared to placebo.
[57.98s -> 58.62s]  The same.
[58.62s -> 61.28s]  The safety profile of creatine is excellent.
[61.46s -> 65.42s]  We've looked at liver and kidney for multiple years, and even at higher dosages, there are
[65.42s -> 67.62s]  no greater adverse effects compared to placebo.
[68.00s -> 74.32s]  In this exchange, you will learn what creatine is, how much our body makes, differences between
[74.32s -> 80.72s]  creatine stores in omnivores and vegetarians, how creatine affects muscle, bone, and brain
[80.72s -> 86.92s]  health, the optimal dosing strategy, including the amount and timing, how to reduce water
[86.92s -> 88.22s]  retention from creatine.
[88.62s -> 95.38s]  If creatine increases hair loss, if creatine strains the liver and kidneys, and much more.
[95.78s -> 96.78s]  Enjoy.
[101.78s -> 108.46s]  I understand from doing a little bit of research into your career so far that you did your
[108.46s -> 112.60s]  Masters with Filth Chillibeck, I didn't realize that.
[112.60s -> 118.46s]  Is that what got you initially interested in studying supplements and eventually becoming
[118.46s -> 119.46s]  interested in creatine?
[119.46s -> 120.46s]  Yeah.
[120.46s -> 125.46s]  I think Phil is one of the best researchers in addition to creatine researcher focus.
[125.46s -> 126.46s]  He does a lot of elegant work.
[126.46s -> 131.46s]  Actually, there was another colleague of mine, Dr. Darren Burke, who's more moved into industry.
[131.46s -> 137.46s]  We did some of the first studies in vegetarians and creatine with muscle biopsies.
[137.46s -> 140.46s]  I sort of was looking at the amino acid glutamine.
[140.46s -> 143.46s]  At the time, glutamine seemed to be the biggest rage.
[143.46s -> 147.46s]  We wanted to see could it affect or improve resistance to creatine.
[147.46s -> 148.42s]  Dr. Dan Burke?
[148.42s -> 149.42s]  Yeah.
[149.42s -> 151.42s]  We were kind of a seminal study.
[151.42s -> 154.42s]  We gave a very high dose of glutamine and it kind of did nothing.
[154.42s -> 159.42s]  At the same time, you say, okay, well, there's a non-essential amino acid, which makes sense
[159.42s -> 161.42s]  from a resistance training standpoint.
[161.42s -> 163.42s]  It didn't really have any effect.
[163.42s -> 169.42s]  At the same time, creatine was really emerging from professional athletes to recreationally
[169.42s -> 170.42s]  athletes.
[170.42s -> 174.42s]  I sort of piggybacked off Darren Burke and Phil Chillibeck's interest on creatine.
[174.42s -> 177.42s]  I've been doing it now for the last two decades.
[177.42s -> 182.42s]  Two, two and a half decades, and we've sort of scratched the surface of the iceberg, so
[182.42s -> 183.42s]  to speak.
[183.42s -> 190.42s]  Your research into glutamine left you feeling that this was not an effective supplement.
[190.42s -> 197.42s]  I remember in my early 20s, it was something everyone that was in the gym that was trying
[197.42s -> 202.42s]  to put on a bit of muscle and strength, everyone was supplementing with glutamine at that time.
[202.42s -> 203.42s]  Yeah, you're right.
[203.42s -> 206.42s]  I mean, it might have some potential impact for decreasing inflammation in weight.
[206.42s -> 211.42s]  It might have some potential impact for increasing inflammation in long, long duration.
[211.42s -> 216.42s]  It may help in metabolic conditions, sepsis or cancer, but to the healthy individual,
[216.42s -> 220.42s]  it's probably one of the most worthless things you could buy.
[220.42s -> 223.42s]  Then there's been study after study on that, and it makes sense.
[223.42s -> 227.42s]  It's non-essential amino acid, so why would it have any benefit?
[227.42s -> 234.42s]  As much as I was disappointed that not finding results, Phil suggested not finding a result
[234.42s -> 235.42s]  is just as important.
[235.42s -> 236.42s]  It's just a matter of how you're going to get back to society.
[236.42s -> 241.42s]  So you kind of emphasized there the fact that glutamine is non-essential.
[241.42s -> 246.42s]  So, with that in mind, it's not that surprising that supplementing it doesn't seem to have
[246.42s -> 249.42s]  a huge effect because your body can synthesize it.
[249.42s -> 254.42s]  But how is that different to creatine?
[254.42s -> 260.42s]  Why the interest in creatine if the body can also synthesize creatine?
[260.42s -> 263.42s]  Yeah, so creatine's a little unique, and it's not that far off.
[263.42s -> 264.42s]  It's made of three amino acids.
[265.42s -> 270.42s]  It's arginine, glycine, and methionine, so a combination of non-essential and essential.
[270.42s -> 276.42s]  But this is a bit interesting where glutamine would have come into the body and it's metabolized.
[276.42s -> 278.42s]  Creatine sort of likes to stay intact.
[278.42s -> 282.42s]  In other words, it doesn't really get broken down to those three amino acids.
[282.42s -> 287.42s]  The other thing is some will argue that creatine is conditionally essential.
[287.42s -> 293.42s]  I don't have a problem with that in certain circumstances, but I would also argue vegans
[293.42s -> 298.42s]  and vegetarians and those on a plant-based diet with natural synthesis of creatine can
[298.42s -> 303.42s]  have long, healthy lives and perform very well from an exercise perspective.
[303.42s -> 308.42s]  What we're starting to see in the last, geez, 30, 40 years is that increased creatine, especially
[308.42s -> 311.42s]  in the muscle, can give greater benefits.
[311.42s -> 316.42s]  So, it may be okay to just have a maintenance being naturally synthesized through the diet,
[316.42s -> 320.42s]  but taking in more seems to provide some beneficial effects.
[320.42s -> 322.42s]  So, someone might be listening to that.
[322.42s -> 330.42s]  And thinking, if the body can produce its own creatine, a certain amount, why would
[330.42s -> 333.42s]  we need a direct source of creatine from food or a supplement?
[333.42s -> 337.42s]  Why wouldn't the body just produce the optimal amount?
[337.42s -> 338.42s]  Yeah.
[338.42s -> 339.42s]  Yeah.
[339.42s -> 341.42s]  That's a great question for an evolutionary biologist.
[341.42s -> 343.42s]  I wish it did produce more.
[343.42s -> 347.42s]  But the other thing that we don't usually discuss, and this can get some false positives
[347.42s -> 352.42s]  when you go to your doctor, when you're annual physical, is as much as we produce about what
[352.42s -> 355.42s]  one to three grams primarily in the liver and or brain.
[355.42s -> 359.42s]  We also excrete about that much as a form of creatinine.
[359.42s -> 361.42s]  So, there's a nice equal balance.
[361.42s -> 366.42s]  And then in 1996, a couple of researchers that are the most famous, Eric Hultman and
[366.42s -> 371.42s]  Roger Harris, clearly showed that if you're taking a little bit more, that can actually
[371.42s -> 372.42s]  accumulate, right?
[372.42s -> 373.42s]  So, there's the big difference.
[373.42s -> 378.42s]  Accumulating in our tissues, primarily muscle, and then if the muscle has more of this energy
[378.42s -> 380.42s]  currency, maybe you can perform more repetitions.
[380.42s -> 381.42s]  You can recover quicker.
[381.42s -> 386.42s]  And over time, it may allow the individual to get bigger, stronger, faster.
[386.42s -> 392.42s]  So, you can also get creatine in the diet, but it's primarily only in red meat and seafood.
[392.42s -> 393.42s]  So, yes.
[393.42s -> 394.42s]  Do you need supplementation?
[394.42s -> 396.42s]  The answer is no.
[396.42s -> 400.42s]  Is it difficult to get the amount needed to show some beneficial effects?
[400.42s -> 401.42s]  It is.
[401.42s -> 406.42s]  You would probably have to consume at least one to two servings of red meat or seafood
[406.42s -> 407.42s]  a day.
[407.42s -> 410.42s]  And then what about the majority of the population?
[410.42s -> 414.42s]  Vegetarians, vegans, those emphasizing a plant-based diet.
[414.42s -> 416.42s]  Maybe they're allergic to seafood.
[416.42s -> 417.42s]  Those all have issues.
[417.42s -> 423.42s]  So, I think it's one of the ingredients or compounds where supplementation might be just
[423.42s -> 424.42s]  the easiest.
[424.42s -> 427.42s]  It's kind of like a protein shake.
[427.42s -> 431.42s]  Some people say, it's very hard for me to get my total daily amount of protein through
[431.42s -> 432.42s]  food.
[432.42s -> 436.42s]  Is it okay to have a whey protein shake or whatever?
[436.42s -> 437.42s]  And I'm saying, of course.
[437.42s -> 439.42s]  If you're trying to achieve a certain amount.
[439.42s -> 442.42s]  I see no reason why that's difficult.
[442.42s -> 447.42s]  But the cost of food worldwide is really high.
[447.42s -> 450.42s]  Environmental sustainability, ethical treatment of animals.
[450.42s -> 453.42s]  There's a lot of issues why people say, hey, you know what?
[453.42s -> 458.42s]  I can get it through red meat or seafood or commercially manufactured creatine.
[458.42s -> 464.42s]  My understanding, and you kind of just spoke to this, is that if we don't have creatine
[464.42s -> 468.42s]  in our diet, the amount that would be in, say, an average diet, which I think is about
[468.42s -> 469.42s]  one gram a day.
[469.42s -> 470.42s]  Is that right?
[470.42s -> 471.42s]  About one to three.
[471.42s -> 473.42s]  Now, if you're on a carnivore diet, you're going to be taking more.
[473.42s -> 478.42s]  But just say the average omnivore who consumes a bit of red meat or seafood, maybe one to
[478.42s -> 480.42s]  two, maybe three grams a day at most.
[480.42s -> 481.42s]  Right.
[481.42s -> 486.42s]  So, my understanding is if you don't have that amount in your diet or you're not taking
[486.42s -> 492.42s]  a supplement, that our body would only be able to replace about half of the creatine
[492.42s -> 494.42s]  that it's using every day.
[494.42s -> 495.42s]  Is that right?
[495.42s -> 496.42s]  It's a rough estimate.
[496.42s -> 497.42s]  So, some people will excrete more.
[497.42s -> 501.42s]  Some people will excrete more creatine in the form of creatinine compared to others.
[501.42s -> 504.42s]  A lot of that has to do with how much muscle mass they also have.
[504.42s -> 506.42s]  But it also has to do with activity.
[506.42s -> 511.42s]  So, the more activity you have, the more creatine will be recycled in the muscle.
[511.42s -> 514.42s]  Of course, that leads to also synthesis as well.
[514.42s -> 515.42s]  But you're right.
[515.42s -> 520.42s]  You kind of need a combination of natural synthesis, diet, and then see where we're
[520.42s -> 521.42s]  at.
[521.42s -> 526.42s]  So, you've often heard of individuals who are responders or non-responders to creatine.
[527.42s -> 528.42s]  I responded really well.
[528.42s -> 532.42s]  I maybe increased body weight and I got a really good benefit.
[532.42s -> 536.42s]  Others will say, geez, for no apparent reason, I took creatine supplementation and I didn't
[536.42s -> 538.42s]  notice any effect.
[538.42s -> 544.42s]  So, it has to be based on the equal distribution or equilibrium of all three of those factors.
[544.42s -> 545.42s]  Right.
[545.42s -> 554.42s]  So, whether you're a non-responder or a hyper-responder is mostly determined by your baseline sort
[554.42s -> 556.42s]  of dietary intake of creatine and your creatine storage.
[556.42s -> 559.42s]  And your creatine stores or are there other factors like genetics?
[559.42s -> 560.42s]  Yeah.
[560.42s -> 564.42s]  That's primarily what's dictated, but there's about three other things that can influence
[564.42s -> 565.42s]  it.
[565.42s -> 566.42s]  So, aging.
[566.42s -> 570.42s]  So, the theory is we have a lot of creatine stored in these large muscle fibers called
[570.42s -> 571.42s]  type 2.
[571.42s -> 575.42s]  And the theory with aging, unfortunately, when we get around the fourth or fifth decade,
[575.42s -> 578.42s]  we start to lose these massive muscle fibers.
[578.42s -> 582.42s]  So, the theory is creatine may be slightly impaired in older adults.
[582.42s -> 585.42s]  And with Phil Chellebeck, we put out a good review on that.
[585.42s -> 587.42s]  Primarily in the lower limbs.
[587.42s -> 588.42s]  The other is sex.
[588.42s -> 593.42s]  We think that females, for some reason, sorry, biological females with the XX chromosome,
[593.42s -> 598.42s]  they might have a slight impairment in the ability to respond.
[598.42s -> 600.42s]  We're not sure if estrogen is involved.
[600.42s -> 604.42s]  And that's an area that's controversial, but there is some evidence.
[604.42s -> 610.42s]  And the other seems to be the amount of red meat or activity that they're doing.
[610.42s -> 614.42s]  So, if your diet is low in red meat or seafood, you may respond better.
[614.42s -> 617.42s]  Whereas if you have higher amounts, you're going to respond less.
[617.42s -> 624.42s]  So, it's kind of how much you have genetically, your diet, biological sex, and maybe activity
[624.42s -> 625.42s]  level.
[625.42s -> 628.42s]  Those are the four things we think really dictate your responsiveness.
[628.42s -> 634.42s]  Where did the early interest in creatine take us back into, I guess, some of the history
[634.42s -> 635.42s]  books here?
[635.42s -> 639.42s]  What did the early science looking at creatine and human health look like?
[639.42s -> 641.42s]  Yeah, it was so interesting.
[641.42s -> 643.42s]  Discovered in 1832 by a French biochemist.
[643.42s -> 651.42s]  And then we had a lag of about 50 years before some biochemists and food biologists started
[651.42s -> 654.42s]  to extract this compound from meat.
[654.42s -> 658.42s]  It was discovered actually before ATP, which is ironic.
[658.42s -> 660.42s]  And then there was a lag.
[660.42s -> 662.42s]  We sort of knew what the molecule was.
[662.42s -> 668.42s]  We kind of theorized that it helped maintain ATP or the energy currency of our cell.
[668.42s -> 672.42s]  And then when some professional athletes, like for Christy and some major league athletes,
[672.42s -> 677.42s]  started to say they were taking creatine, a lot of people noticed that their performance
[677.42s -> 678.42s]  went up.
[678.42s -> 683.42s]  And then research supported it by Roger Harris and Eric Holtman and a few others, Paul Greenhalf,
[683.42s -> 688.42s]  the list goes on and on, clearly showing that if you were to supplement your diet, creatine
[688.42s -> 689.42s]  will get in the muscle.
[689.42s -> 694.42s]  And of course, if you have more creatine in the muscle, it will help maintain ATP during
[694.42s -> 695.42s]  exercise.
[695.42s -> 697.42s]  So, it was really designed for weightlifters.
[697.42s -> 700.42s]  They're in the gym doing multiple sets, very healthy, very healthy.
[700.42s -> 701.42s]  They're going to have a lot of energy.
[701.42s -> 703.42s]  They're doing multiple sets, very heavy weight.
[703.42s -> 709.42s]  It allowed those individuals to potentially put on or increase exercise volume.
[709.42s -> 713.42s]  And then when you ask these individuals on creatine, they say they seem to be able to
[713.42s -> 714.42s]  recover quicker.
[714.42s -> 717.42s]  And we weren't really sure the mechanisms why that is.
[717.42s -> 721.42s]  And it's really prevalent in long distance aerobic athletes.
[721.42s -> 725.42s]  So now it seems to be viable for most athletes.
[725.42s -> 729.42s]  And of course, the big area in the last 20 years is the health impact.
[729.42s -> 731.42s]  We sort of got bored with all the exercise.
[731.42s -> 735.42s]  And then we said, well, geez, what about the aging individual whose muscle and bone
[735.42s -> 736.42s]  is losing?
[736.42s -> 738.42s]  What about the person diagnosed with concussion?
[738.42s -> 744.42s]  So, we've kind of opened Pandora's box and we're starting to see creatine be used
[744.42s -> 746.42s]  from a medical and health application.
[746.42s -> 753.42s]  Are those mechanisms that might explain improved recovery, are they better understood today?
[753.42s -> 757.42s]  They're slightly better understood today, but they're certainly better understood
[757.42s -> 759.42s]  in the aerobic exercise.
[759.42s -> 760.42s]  So, this is quite interesting.
[760.42s -> 765.42s]  When you're lifting weights very heavily, we always think it's very inflammatory.
[765.42s -> 770.42s]  But the thing with regular resistance training, it actually improves your immune system.
[770.42s -> 773.42s]  And we release these proteins called cytokines.
[773.42s -> 778.42s]  So, the theory here was that creatine has been shown to have some anti-catabolic or
[778.42s -> 780.42s]  anti-inflammatory effects.
[780.42s -> 786.42s]  But it's only been shown in long duration cardio, such as Ironman or triathlon.
[786.42s -> 787.42s]  And that kind of makes sense.
[787.42s -> 789.42s]  If you're going to put your body through 40 kilograms of cardio, you're going to have
[789.42s -> 794.42s]  40 kilograms or 40 kilometers or more of a continuous aerobic exercise.
[794.42s -> 796.42s]  It's going to be very inflammatory.
[796.42s -> 800.42s]  A lot of catabolic enzymes and hormones will be released.
[800.42s -> 804.42s]  And when you look at those studies, those individuals who took creatine before they
[804.42s -> 809.42s]  did the race, they had a huge reduction in the amount of those inflammatory proteins
[809.42s -> 810.42s]  compared to placebo.
[810.42s -> 817.42s]  So, it sort of provided some evidence we have a little bit of recovery aspects to creatine.
[817.42s -> 822.42s]  But when we look at acute resistance training, you know, you do a set for maybe 10, 12 seconds.
[822.42s -> 823.42s]  You rest for three minutes.
[823.42s -> 829.42s]  I think that recovery there is not catabolic enough to induce inflammation.
[829.42s -> 833.42s]  And creatine has not been shown to reduce inflammation with resistance training.
[833.42s -> 840.42s]  Those studies that have looked at recovery, have they looked at how that impacts performance
[840.42s -> 841.42s]  outcomes?
[841.42s -> 843.42s]  That's an excellent question.
[843.42s -> 846.42s]  So, they haven't looked at the ability to subsequently perform a race.
[846.42s -> 848.42s]  Or recover more.
[848.42s -> 851.42s]  They just simply looked at the blood biomarkers.
[851.42s -> 853.42s]  That's a really good idea.
[853.42s -> 858.42s]  The theory is that if you could recover quicker, could you enhance performance over time?
[858.42s -> 863.42s]  With the upcoming Olympics, a lot of athletes are combining aerobic and resistance training.
[863.42s -> 868.42s]  Could this be a recovery agent to allow them to train at a really high volume?
[868.42s -> 871.42s]  Those studies need to be performed.
[871.42s -> 876.42s]  You mentioned before that over the last few years,
[876.42s -> 884.42s]  there's been a lot of interest in creatine and other aspects of health outside of muscle mass and strength,
[884.42s -> 887.42s]  where a lot of the early research has been focused.
[887.42s -> 892.42s]  In 2019, you wrote a review about creatine and healthy aging.
[892.42s -> 900.42s]  And one of the things that you state is that creatine supplementation can have a positive effect on aging muscle.
[900.42s -> 905.42s]  What do you mean exactly by a positive effect on aging muscle?
[906.42s -> 908.42s]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[908.42s -> 911.42s]  Because I consider aging the fourth decade and above.
[911.42s -> 914.42s]  And I'm 46, so I fall into that category, unfortunately.
[914.42s -> 919.42s]  But the biological process of aging with Inflam aging or heightened inflammation,
[919.42s -> 923.42s]  unfortunately, we lose three things primarily from a soft tissue.
[923.42s -> 925.42s]  We decrease strength.
[925.42s -> 927.42s]  We now know we lose muscle mass.
[927.42s -> 929.42s]  Or you could argue lean tissue in that category.
[929.42s -> 932.42s]  And then, of course, functional ability.
[932.42s -> 934.42s]  The ability to perform activities of daily living.
[934.42s -> 935.42s]  And those three.
[935.42s -> 943.42s]  Those three caveats of sarcopenia really have a catastrophic effect on our ability to live long, healthy lifestyles.
[943.42s -> 948.42s]  And so, unfortunately, with exercise or lack of, we lose all three of those aspects.
[948.42s -> 954.42s]  And then when you look at the research in younger individuals, creatine was shown to perform all three of those categories.
[954.42s -> 956.42s]  It increased muscle strength.
[956.42s -> 959.42s]  It had beneficial effects on muscle mass and lean tissue mass.
[959.42s -> 962.42s]  And, of course, it improved some passive functionality.
[962.42s -> 965.42s]  And then when you look at the smaller body of research,
[965.42s -> 969.42s]  in older adults, sure enough, it had all those beneficial effects as well.
[969.42s -> 975.42s]  And, again, it improved measures of strength, muscle mass, lean tissue mass, and functional ability.
[975.42s -> 981.42s]  So, we theorize it has some beneficial effects for the aging body.
[981.42s -> 985.42s]  What hasn't been shown is diagnosed sarcopenic adults,
[985.42s -> 990.42s]  where we take an adult coming into the clinic and diagnose them with a specific criteria.
[990.42s -> 993.42s]  Can creatine have specific anti-sarcopenic effects?
[993.42s -> 996.42s]  We've applied to the government to do that study.
[996.42s -> 999.42s]  And we're hoping to get funding down the road.
[999.42s -> 1006.42s]  And that may have applications for offsetting frailty, bed rest, long-term care facility uptake.
[1006.42s -> 1011.42s]  So, we're trying to improve healthy aging from exercise and creatine.
[1011.42s -> 1015.42s]  But at the end of the day, any benefits that creatine provides,
[1015.42s -> 1019.42s]  98% is coming from resistance exercise.
[1019.42s -> 1022.42s]  Maybe 2% to 5%, if you want to fluctuate those,
[1022.42s -> 1024.42s]  is coming from creatine.
[1024.42s -> 1027.42s]  You've got to have the stimulus from exercise to be there.
[1027.42s -> 1034.42s]  So, right now, the kind of body of research looking at this
[1034.42s -> 1038.42s]  is pulling bits of information from younger adults
[1038.42s -> 1042.42s]  and the effect that we see creatine has on muscle mass and strength
[1042.42s -> 1045.42s]  in the context of doing resistance training.
[1045.42s -> 1052.42s]  And so, we're assuming that creatine has a similar effect in older people.
[1052.42s -> 1056.42s]  And because we know that from the fifth decade on
[1056.42s -> 1060.42s]  that people are losing a considerable amount of muscle mass
[1060.42s -> 1067.42s]  and that has a downstream effect on metabolic health and risk of falls,
[1067.42s -> 1072.42s]  that supplementing with creatine and resistance training in this population
[1072.42s -> 1075.42s]  might be able to kind of curb some of that muscle loss
[1075.42s -> 1080.42s]  and the risk of sarcopenia and the metabolic consequences that come with that.
[1080.42s -> 1081.42s]  Yes, that's correct.
[1081.42s -> 1083.42s]  Just for clarification, though,
[1083.42s -> 1087.42s]  we probably have, there is probably about 20 to 30 papers
[1087.42s -> 1089.42s]  or studies specifically in older adults.
[1089.42s -> 1094.42s]  So, we had all that justification or foundational information from younger adults.
[1094.42s -> 1097.42s]  But there's probably 20 to 30 studies that have looked at specifically
[1097.42s -> 1099.42s]  creatine and exercise in older adults.
[1099.42s -> 1103.42s]  And we sort of have an emerging area of response.
[1103.42s -> 1106.42s]  The issue with individual studies is they're usually small sample size.
[1106.42s -> 1110.42s]  So, that's why there's about five meta-analysis that have been published now
[1110.42s -> 1114.42s]  that have looked at all the data in individual studies of older adults.
[1114.42s -> 1119.42s]  And collectively, they're showing an increase in lean tissue strength and functionality.
[1119.42s -> 1121.42s]  So, we actually have good data in younger individuals
[1121.42s -> 1125.42s]  and some emerging research in older adults as well.
[1125.42s -> 1129.42s]  One of the things that I spoke to Stuart Phillips about
[1129.42s -> 1132.42s]  with regards to the elderly and resistance training
[1132.42s -> 1135.42s]  was that they may require more protein
[1135.42s -> 1138.42s]  to get the same muscle protein synthesis response
[1138.42s -> 1140.42s]  because of anabolic resistance.
[1140.42s -> 1147.42s]  Is this a similar kind of scenario with regards to creatine?
[1147.42s -> 1153.42s]  Is it likely that the dosing for a young or mid-life adult
[1153.42s -> 1158.42s]  might be different to someone that's in their fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth decade of life?
[1158.42s -> 1161.42s]  Yeah, it's very plausible from three aspects.
[1161.42s -> 1164.42s]  So, a review we published, me and Dr. Schoellebeck,
[1164.42s -> 1167.42s]  we clearly showed that the vastus lateralis
[1167.42s -> 1170.42s]  or the big muscles in the quadriceps when you're doing leg press
[1170.42s -> 1173.42s]  or squat, they seem to be jeopardized by creatine kinetics
[1173.42s -> 1175.42s]  more than other muscles.
[1175.42s -> 1178.42s]  So, there could be some line of evidence to suggest that
[1178.42s -> 1180.42s]  aging does impair creatine kinetics.
[1180.42s -> 1183.42s]  So, you might think, okay, they may need more.
[1183.42s -> 1185.42s]  And then the other lines of thought are that
[1185.42s -> 1190.42s]  in a few of our studies, when we gave 0.1 gram of creatine per kilogram
[1190.42s -> 1192.42s]  or about seven to eight grams a day,
[1192.42s -> 1197.42s]  it had some potential effects on certain aspects of daily living,
[1197.42s -> 1200.42s]  but we did not see an increase in lean tissue
[1200.42s -> 1202.42s]  or strength.
[1202.42s -> 1205.42s]  So, the theory here was that maybe you need to give more as well.
[1205.42s -> 1208.42s]  So, we've never specifically looked at a higher dosing study,
[1208.42s -> 1213.42s]  but I will preface that the longest study that we've ever published just came out,
[1213.42s -> 1215.42s]  and I'm sure we'll talk about this on bone,
[1215.42s -> 1219.42s]  where we gave about 10 to 11 grams a day for two straight years.
[1219.42s -> 1224.42s]  So, we theorized actually in that paper about anabolic resistance in older adults.
[1224.42s -> 1227.42s]  And lo and behold, that higher dose did improve lean tissue mass
[1227.42s -> 1229.42s]  and some measures of functional capacity,
[1229.42s -> 1233.42s]  but 0.1 gram in the same population of older adults didn't.
[1233.42s -> 1236.42s]  So, there's a few emerging areas where we're thinking
[1236.42s -> 1242.42s]  that maybe older adults might be able to respond a little bit more favorably.
[1242.42s -> 1246.42s]  And I would sort of use that analogy with anabolic resistance.
[1246.42s -> 1248.42s]  You know, when you're in your 20s and 30s,
[1248.42s -> 1252.42s]  20, 25 grams of protein seems to be very viable.
[1252.42s -> 1254.42s]  When you get in the 50s and older,
[1254.42s -> 1259.42s]  maybe you need 40, 45 grams or more to overcome that anabolic resistance.
[1259.42s -> 1263.42s]  Maybe creatine, which is very similar in the mechanisms to protein,
[1263.42s -> 1264.42s]  needs to be higher as well,
[1264.42s -> 1267.42s]  but that's an area that our lab is currently looking at.
[1267.42s -> 1274.42s]  Right. So, just to kind of make this clear for the listener,
[1274.42s -> 1278.42s]  in midlife or early adulthood,
[1278.42s -> 1282.42s]  that typical creatine dose from a muscle mass and strength point of view
[1282.42s -> 1286.42s]  is usually somewhere in the ballpark of 3 to 5 grams a day, right?
[1286.42s -> 1287.42s]  That's correct, yeah.
[1287.42s -> 1288.42s]  And what you're saying is,
[1288.42s -> 1292.42s]  for someone who's older, it could be 7, 8 grams a day
[1292.42s -> 1294.42s]  or perhaps a little bit more.
[1294.42s -> 1296.42s]  Yeah, that's the key word there, could.
[1296.42s -> 1301.42s]  There is some studies that have shown 5 grams is very viable and effective
[1301.42s -> 1303.42s]  in healthy older adults.
[1303.42s -> 1305.42s]  Then there's other studies that show a bit more.
[1305.42s -> 1310.42s]  The nice thing with the design of these randomized control trials,
[1310.42s -> 1313.42s]  the safety profile of creatine is excellent.
[1313.42s -> 1316.42s]  We've looked at liver and kidney for multiple years.
[1316.42s -> 1317.42s]  And even at higher doses,
[1317.42s -> 1320.42s]  there's no greater adverse effects compared to placebo.
[1320.42s -> 1323.42s]  So, even if the individual is taking a bit more,
[1323.42s -> 1327.42s]  which could lead to potentially some benefits,
[1327.42s -> 1330.42s]  they should not experience any adverse effects.
[1330.42s -> 1334.42s]  But I'm confident that if you were to take 3 to 5 grams a day,
[1334.42s -> 1335.42s]  even in an older adult,
[1335.42s -> 1337.42s]  that would eventually accumulate.
[1337.42s -> 1340.42s]  You might get a better response with a little bit more.
[1340.42s -> 1343.42s]  But now, that's just on a muscle perspective.
[1343.42s -> 1345.42s]  If we get into bone and brain research,
[1345.42s -> 1346.42s]  that might dictate a little bit more.
[1346.42s -> 1350.42s]  Yeah, we're going to get there.
[1350.42s -> 1355.42s]  Remind us what the mechanism is by which creatine
[1355.42s -> 1358.42s]  can have this effect on muscle mass and strength.
[1358.42s -> 1361.42s]  Yes, so it's very multifactorial.
[1361.42s -> 1363.42s]  And it's a little bit different than protein.
[1363.42s -> 1364.42s]  A lot of people think they go hand in hand,
[1364.42s -> 1366.42s]  but there's a bit of difference.
[1366.42s -> 1368.42s]  So, a lot of people who have tried creatine say,
[1368.42s -> 1370.42s]  hey, they might have experienced a little bit of weight gain
[1370.42s -> 1374.42s]  or maybe a little bit of bloating during the initial stages.
[1374.42s -> 1375.42s]  And creatine is osmotic.
[1375.42s -> 1379.42s]  So, when it leads your small intestine and enters the blood,
[1379.42s -> 1382.42s]  it likes to drag water into your muscle.
[1382.42s -> 1384.42s]  And so, the principle of osmosis will be
[1384.42s -> 1387.42s]  when a solute is going into an area,
[1387.42s -> 1389.42s]  water will maintain equilibrium.
[1389.42s -> 1392.42s]  So, you're going to have a little bit of water coming in.
[1392.42s -> 1396.42s]  And by swelling the cell, or in this case muscle,
[1396.42s -> 1399.42s]  that seems to turn on a whole bunch of beneficial things
[1399.42s -> 1403.42s]  within the cell or under the sarcolemma.
[1403.42s -> 1405.42s]  Your viewers may have heard of things called
[1405.42s -> 1408.42s]  transcription factors or satellite cells
[1408.42s -> 1410.42s]  or insulin-like growth factor one.
[1410.42s -> 1413.42s]  They all seem to get increased in the presence of creatine
[1413.42s -> 1415.42s]  when the cell is swollen.
[1415.42s -> 1420.42s]  It has some ability to turn on proteins in the mTOR pathway.
[1420.42s -> 1423.42s]  And it has actually been shown to increase calcium
[1423.42s -> 1425.42s]  and glycogen kinetics.
[1425.42s -> 1427.42s]  So, when you put all those things together,
[1427.42s -> 1430.42s]  it basically helps them create an anabolic environment
[1430.42s -> 1432.42s]  for muscle growth.
[1432.42s -> 1434.42s]  I should be clear, it's never been shown to increase
[1434.42s -> 1437.42s]  the rates of protein synthesis directly.
[1437.42s -> 1440.42s]  So, unlike whey protein or other protein which has,
[1440.42s -> 1443.42s]  creatine sort of works other ways.
[1443.42s -> 1446.42s]  It may allow the muscle cell to just have a greater capacity
[1446.42s -> 1448.42s]  to do more work or respond.
[1448.42s -> 1450.42s]  But it also has been shown to decrease
[1450.42s -> 1452.42s]  muscle protein catabolism.
[1452.42s -> 1455.42s]  So, it may maintain the integrity of the cell
[1455.42s -> 1457.42s]  a little bit more.
[1457.42s -> 1460.42s]  And again, primarily in rodents or those long duration
[1460.42s -> 1463.42s]  aerobic exercise, it may have the ability to decrease
[1463.42s -> 1465.42s]  inflammation.
[1465.42s -> 1467.42s]  And we know inflammation is the main precursor
[1467.42s -> 1470.42s]  for muscle protein breakdown or oxidative stress.
[1470.42s -> 1473.42s]  So, there's probably about 10 purported mechanisms
[1473.42s -> 1475.42s]  how it works.
[1475.42s -> 1478.42s]  But cell swelling seems to be something that needs
[1478.42s -> 1481.42s]  to be there to turn on all these processes.
[1481.42s -> 1484.42s]  You mentioned there that creatine might help the muscles
[1484.42s -> 1486.42s]  do more work.
[1486.42s -> 1489.42s]  The idea being there that if you do greater volume,
[1489.42s -> 1492.42s]  rep sets and or load,
[1492.42s -> 1496.42s]  that you get greater adaptations from your training?
[1496.42s -> 1499.42s]  Yeah, that's kind of the subjective way
[1499.42s -> 1501.42s]  that we theorize it works.
[1501.42s -> 1504.42s]  We've shown in older adults especially that creatine
[1504.42s -> 1506.42s]  can increase training volume,
[1506.42s -> 1508.42s]  which is actually correlated with performance.
[1508.42s -> 1510.42s]  But there's been many studies that have shown that
[1510.42s -> 1513.42s]  creatine did not have a difference compared to placebo
[1513.42s -> 1514.42s]  in training volume.
[1514.42s -> 1517.42s]  Yet, it still led to improvements.
[1517.42s -> 1520.42s]  So, not necessarily always dictated by training volume.
[1520.42s -> 1522.42s]  There seems to be some substance,
[1522.42s -> 1524.42s]  some cellular reasons why creatine could at least
[1524.42s -> 1527.42s]  increase the size and or strength of the muscle.
[1527.42s -> 1530.42s]  What happens if someone supplements with creatine
[1530.42s -> 1533.42s]  but doesn't do resistance training?
[1533.42s -> 1536.42s]  Does their strength or muscle size change?
[1536.42s -> 1541.42s]  We only see an increase in body water retention
[1541.42s -> 1545.42s]  and or some minimal benefits on muscle
[1545.42s -> 1547.42s]  or neuromuscular function.
[1547.42s -> 1551.42s]  That's primarily ever been shown in older populations.
[1551.42s -> 1554.42s]  If there are a few studies in younger populations,
[1554.42s -> 1556.42s]  I'm not really that aware.
[1556.42s -> 1559.42s]  It seems like exercise,
[1559.42s -> 1561.42s]  primarily resistance training or weight training,
[1561.42s -> 1563.42s]  needs to be there to create the stimulus
[1563.42s -> 1565.42s]  for these processes to occur.
[1565.42s -> 1568.42s]  With regards to the dose,
[1568.42s -> 1571.42s]  before we spoke about three to five grams per day,
[1571.42s -> 1577.42s]  it might be a little bit more if you're considered elderly.
[1577.42s -> 1580.42s]  Should we be thinking about creatine supplementation
[1580.42s -> 1584.42s]  in terms of a fixed amount in grams like this for everyone
[1584.42s -> 1589.42s]  or should it be grams per kilogram of lean mass
[1589.42s -> 1591.42s]  so that that dose is a bit more specific
[1591.42s -> 1594.42s]  to how much muscle they have?
[1594.42s -> 1595.42s]  Yes.
[1595.42s -> 1597.42s]  So, this is a very good question and interesting.
[1597.42s -> 1602.42s]  So, the absolute usually is based on the convenience
[1602.42s -> 1603.42s]  of just saying,
[1603.42s -> 1605.42s]  hey, I'm going to take three to five grams
[1605.42s -> 1606.42s]  or a half a teaspoon
[1606.42s -> 1607.42s]  or the loading phase,
[1607.42s -> 1609.42s]  which a lot of athletes will adopt
[1609.42s -> 1611.42s]  because they really need a quick rapid boost.
[1611.42s -> 1614.42s]  That's like 20 grams a day for five to seven days.
[1614.42s -> 1617.42s]  But there was a paper published in 2003 by Adam Persky
[1617.42s -> 1620.42s]  and I think it's one of the best reviews ever done on creatine.
[1620.42s -> 1623.42s]  And he made the case that the larger you are,
[1623.42s -> 1627.42s]  you're going to probably have more creatine transport kinetics turned on.
[1627.42s -> 1629.42s]  It's very similar to maybe protein.
[1629.42s -> 1631.42s]  If you're 100 kilograms versus 50,
[1631.42s -> 1633.42s]  maybe you're going to need more.
[1633.42s -> 1635.42s]  And he made the good case that
[1635.42s -> 1637.42s]  or theorized that the larger you are,
[1637.42s -> 1639.42s]  you may have more muscle mass.
[1639.42s -> 1641.42s]  And if you have more muscle mass,
[1641.42s -> 1643.42s]  you may have more of these creatine doorways
[1643.42s -> 1644.42s]  that allow creatine in.
[1644.42s -> 1647.42s]  It's very similar to GLUT4 with glucose.
[1647.42s -> 1650.42s]  So, we've been toying with this idea ever since we started
[1650.42s -> 1652.42s]  to base it on relative size.
[1652.42s -> 1654.42s]  We get people to come into the lab.
[1654.42s -> 1655.42s]  They go on a scale.
[1655.42s -> 1657.42s]  And if they're 70 kilograms,
[1657.42s -> 1658.42s]  they get seven grams a day.
[1658.42s -> 1659.42s]  If they're 50 kilograms,
[1659.42s -> 1660.42s]  they get five.
[1660.42s -> 1663.42s]  And we've shown that dose to be very effective,
[1663.42s -> 1666.42s]  resulting in no adverse effects.
[1666.42s -> 1669.42s]  So, I think it's kind of just taken
[1669.42s -> 1671.42s]  the idea of maybe the person who's
[1671.42s -> 1673.42s]  an offensive lineman in the NFL
[1673.42s -> 1675.42s]  or Aussie rules football, whatever,
[1675.42s -> 1677.42s]  they might need more compared to someone
[1677.42s -> 1679.42s]  who's a child, for example.
[1679.42s -> 1682.42s]  So, that's kind of why we did it.
[1682.42s -> 1684.42s]  But there's two viable ways.
[1684.42s -> 1686.42s]  It looks like you can go either way,
[1686.42s -> 1688.42s]  an absolute or a relative dose.
[1688.42s -> 1691.42s]  I'm at the stage now where I kind of know my size
[1691.42s -> 1692.42s]  and I take a higher dose,
[1692.42s -> 1695.42s]  just easily measured twice a day.
[1695.42s -> 1697.42s]  And that relative dose, though,
[1697.42s -> 1699.42s]  that you've used in your studies,
[1699.42s -> 1703.42s]  actually I've seen you've used a few different doses,
[1703.42s -> 1707.42s]  but one of them is 0.1 grams per kilogram per day.
[1707.42s -> 1709.42s]  Yeah, 99% of our studies use the 0.1.
[1709.42s -> 1712.42s]  And then the only study in the longest trial
[1712.42s -> 1713.42s]  in postmenopausal women,
[1713.42s -> 1715.42s]  we thought about anabolic resistance,
[1715.42s -> 1717.42s]  we gave 0.15,
[1717.42s -> 1720.42s]  which was about 11 grams of monohydrate a day.
[1720.42s -> 1721.42s]  Quick one, folks.
[1721.42s -> 1724.42s]  I get asked all the time about buying supplements
[1724.42s -> 1725.42s]  and getting blood tests.
[1725.42s -> 1727.42s]  The good news is I've created comprehensive
[1727.42s -> 1729.42s]  and completely free guides
[1729.42s -> 1730.42s]  for both.
[1730.42s -> 1732.42s]  Simply head over to my website,
[1732.42s -> 1733.42s]  theproof.com,
[1733.42s -> 1734.42s]  to download them.
[1734.42s -> 1736.42s]  That's theproof.com.
[1736.42s -> 1738.42s]  Okay, let's get back to the episode.
[1738.42s -> 1740.42s]  In your review on healthy aging,
[1740.42s -> 1743.42s]  you mentioned that creatine supplementation
[1743.42s -> 1745.42s]  with resistance training
[1745.42s -> 1748.42s]  compared to placebo with resistance training
[1748.42s -> 1751.42s]  has been shown to significantly improve
[1751.42s -> 1756.42s]  sit-to-stand time in adults in their 50s and 60s.
[1756.42s -> 1759.42s]  Does this suggest that creatine
[1759.42s -> 1762.42s]  could possibly reduce someone's risk of falls
[1762.42s -> 1767.42s]  by improving strength or motor coordination?
[1767.42s -> 1769.42s]  That's an excellent question.
[1769.42s -> 1770.42s]  And that was the theory.
[1770.42s -> 1773.42s]  So it improves sit-to-stand.
[1773.42s -> 1776.42s]  We've also just showed that improved gait speed.
[1776.42s -> 1778.42s]  And Stu Phillips and former colleague,
[1778.42s -> 1780.42s]  Michela Dorese, also showed that it had improvements
[1780.42s -> 1782.42s]  in some functionality.
[1782.42s -> 1783.42s]  And you're 100% right.
[1783.42s -> 1786.42s]  Could creatine improve parameters of muscle?
[1786.42s -> 1788.42s]  Could that lead to a little bit of balance
[1788.42s -> 1790.42s]  or more functional capacity?
[1790.42s -> 1793.42s]  And in the two studies that looked at falls prevalence,
[1793.42s -> 1795.42s]  Bruno Gualiano in Brazil
[1795.42s -> 1797.42s]  and then the one we just talked about,
[1797.42s -> 1799.42s]  we didn't see any difference
[1799.42s -> 1802.42s]  in the number of falls and or fractures.
[1802.42s -> 1804.42s]  In other words, both groups fell.
[1804.42s -> 1807.42s]  Some had small instances of fractures,
[1807.42s -> 1811.42s]  but creatine did not have any adverse or greater effect.
[1811.42s -> 1814.42s]  And of course, the number of falls and fractures
[1814.42s -> 1815.42s]  was so small,
[1815.42s -> 1817.42s]  we probably couldn't make any justifiable conclusions.
[1817.42s -> 1821.42s]  But the theory could be that if the muscles
[1821.42s -> 1823.42s]  and or bone get stronger,
[1823.42s -> 1825.42s]  primarily in the lower limb,
[1825.42s -> 1826.42s]  the hip and or ankle,
[1826.42s -> 1830.42s]  maybe that could withstand some shear factors from falls.
[1830.42s -> 1832.42s]  So that is our hope.
[1832.42s -> 1834.42s]  But of course, we don't know the answer to that.
[1834.42s -> 1837.42s]  And if we're thinking, I guess, more broadly
[1837.42s -> 1839.42s]  about reducing the risk of fractures.
[1839.42s -> 1841.42s]  So there's a couple of different things
[1841.42s -> 1842.42s]  that are important here.
[1842.42s -> 1846.42s]  One is reduce the risk of falling in the first place,
[1846.42s -> 1849.42s]  which is what we're speaking about there.
[1849.42s -> 1853.42s]  And things like strength and coordination
[1853.42s -> 1854.42s]  will play into that
[1854.42s -> 1856.42s]  and other things like polypharmacy
[1856.42s -> 1857.42s]  and a bunch of different risk factors
[1857.42s -> 1859.42s]  that can affect falls risk.
[1859.42s -> 1864.42s]  But then the other really important aspect
[1864.42s -> 1867.42s]  of preventing fractures is having strong bones
[1867.42s -> 1870.42s]  that can withstand the force
[1870.42s -> 1872.42s]  that's incurred with the fall
[1872.42s -> 1875.42s]  and not break under that force.
[1876.42s -> 1879.42s]  You mentioned before that you have this two-year trial
[1879.42s -> 1882.42s]  that you just published recently on postmenopausal women
[1882.42s -> 1884.42s]  looking at creatine supplementation
[1884.42s -> 1889.42s]  and different properties of bone health, bone strength.
[1889.42s -> 1894.42s]  Does creatine supplementation make our bones stronger?
[1894.42s -> 1896.42s]  They can.
[1896.42s -> 1897.42s]  So a little bit of the background.
[1897.42s -> 1899.42s]  It was kind of by accident.
[1899.42s -> 1900.42s]  When you do a DEXA scan,
[1900.42s -> 1901.42s]  you can get some lean tissue.
[1901.42s -> 1904.42s]  And of course, then you can get some measures of bone mineral.
[1904.42s -> 1906.42s]  And there was a cellular study
[1906.42s -> 1908.42s]  done early 2000s,
[1908.42s -> 1910.42s]  which showed these osteoblast cells,
[1910.42s -> 1912.42s]  which are the cells involved in bone formation,
[1912.42s -> 1915.42s]  they became really energized in the presence of creatine.
[1915.42s -> 1918.42s]  So theory was maybe our bone is responsive
[1918.42s -> 1921.42s]  to supplementation as well.
[1921.42s -> 1924.42s]  And then based on the law of muscle-bone interaction,
[1924.42s -> 1925.42s]  if you have more muscle,
[1925.42s -> 1927.42s]  it's going to pull on your bone throughout the day
[1927.42s -> 1929.42s]  when you're performing activities of daily living
[1929.42s -> 1930.42s]  or weightlifting,
[1930.42s -> 1933.42s]  and maybe that could stimulate bone growth.
[1933.42s -> 1934.42s]  And then the question is,
[1934.42s -> 1936.42s]  well, which population would probably benefit
[1936.42s -> 1937.42s]  from having greater bones?
[1937.42s -> 1938.42s]  And of course,
[1938.42s -> 1942.42s]  it's primarily postmenopausal females.
[1942.42s -> 1944.42s]  And so we've done a couple studies now.
[1944.42s -> 1945.42s]  And in the first study,
[1945.42s -> 1946.42s]  it was a low sample size.
[1946.42s -> 1949.42s]  It only had slightly over 30 postmenopausal females.
[1949.42s -> 1952.42s]  We gave 0.1 gram per kilogram of creatine
[1952.42s -> 1954.42s]  for a whole year of resistance training.
[1954.42s -> 1955.42s]  And the reason for that,
[1955.42s -> 1958.42s]  bone takes a long time to turn over,
[1958.42s -> 1959.42s]  at least about six months
[1959.42s -> 1962.42s]  before you're looking at bone mineral density.
[1962.42s -> 1964.42s]  And we showed that creatine reduced
[1964.42s -> 1966.42s]  the rate of bone mineral loss
[1966.42s -> 1969.42s]  in the hip region compared to placebo.
[1969.42s -> 1970.42s]  So they didn't increase,
[1970.42s -> 1971.42s]  but again,
[1971.42s -> 1973.42s]  the relative deficit was the people
[1973.42s -> 1975.42s]  that just performed resistance training
[1975.42s -> 1978.42s]  had a significant decrease in bone mineral density,
[1978.42s -> 1981.42s]  whereas the creatine group was more preserved.
[1981.42s -> 1982.42s]  And then we thought,
[1982.42s -> 1984.42s]  okay, that has some lines of evidence
[1984.42s -> 1986.42s]  to now do a larger study.
[1986.42s -> 1988.42s]  And as you just alluded to,
[1988.42s -> 1990.42s]  it took about a decade to finally get
[1990.42s -> 1992.42s]  from start to finish.
[1992.42s -> 1996.42s]  We had over 200 postmenopausal females randomly,
[1996.42s -> 1998.42s]  and we were able to get
[1998.42s -> 2000.42s]  about 100 postmenopausal females randomly.
[2000.42s -> 2001.42s]  And we were able to get
[2001.42s -> 2003.42s]  about 100 postmenopausal females randomly.
[2003.42s -> 2005.42s]  So the issue with nutritional research,
[2005.42s -> 2007.42s]  any researcher will tell you,
[2007.42s -> 2009.42s]  we're always limited with very small sample sizes.
[2009.42s -> 2011.42s]  So that increases a lot of variability.
[2011.42s -> 2013.42s]  But this was one of the rare creatine studies
[2013.42s -> 2015.42s]  to have over 80% power.
[2015.42s -> 2017.42s]  And we then decided that let's do
[2017.42s -> 2020.42s]  two years of resistance training.
[2020.42s -> 2021.42s]  And this was machine-based,
[2021.42s -> 2023.42s]  supervised three days a week.
[2023.42s -> 2025.42s]  But we also wanted to add in six days of walking
[2025.42s -> 2027.42s]  and then we even did a higher dose,
[2027.42s -> 2029.42s]  0.15 gram.
[2029.42s -> 2030.42s]  So let's summarize.
[2030.42s -> 2033.42s]  They were taking about 11 grams a day,
[2033.42s -> 2035.42s]  three times as much as what we typically recommend
[2035.42s -> 2038.42s]  for young individuals from a muscle perspective.
[2038.42s -> 2041.42s]  They did two years of exercise,
[2041.42s -> 2043.42s]  and the results were kind of encouraging,
[2043.42s -> 2045.42s]  but a little surprising.
[2045.42s -> 2046.42s]  So you would think at that high dose,
[2046.42s -> 2048.42s]  with two years of exercise,
[2048.42s -> 2050.42s]  everything would have went up.
[2050.42s -> 2053.42s]  Actually, the only thing we saw improvements
[2053.42s -> 2055.42s]  was that it improved bone GMO,
[2055.42s -> 2057.42s]  so it increased bone strength,
[2057.42s -> 2059.42s]  and it sort of improved the strength of the bone
[2059.42s -> 2061.42s]  primarily around the hip region,
[2061.42s -> 2063.42s]  which we think is really important
[2063.42s -> 2066.42s]  because that's an area of clinical displacement
[2066.42s -> 2068.42s]  if you suffer a hip fracture.
[2068.42s -> 2070.42s]  We also showed that it improved lean tissue
[2070.42s -> 2073.42s]  and gait speed compared to placebo.
[2073.42s -> 2076.42s]  So there was some advantageous effects.
[2076.42s -> 2078.42s]  The counter argument is,
[2078.42s -> 2081.42s]  what if we had a group who did no exercise?
[2081.42s -> 2084.42s]  I speculate that it would be catastrophic.
[2084.42s -> 2088.42s]  Two years of exercise maintained some areas,
[2088.42s -> 2090.42s]  improved strength a little bit,
[2090.42s -> 2092.42s]  but if we had a group who did nothing,
[2092.42s -> 2094.42s]  which is most of the world's population,
[2094.42s -> 2097.42s]  that might have really catastrophic effects.
[2097.42s -> 2099.42s]  So exercise needs to be there,
[2099.42s -> 2103.42s]  and creatine may give some slightly greater beneficial effects.
[2103.42s -> 2105.42s]  We've also shown some muscle and bone benefits
[2105.42s -> 2107.42s]  in males as well.
[2107.42s -> 2109.42s]  So it's not just a cessation of estrogen.
[2109.42s -> 2112.42s]  We think those things can have some favorable effects.
[2112.42s -> 2116.42s]  Okay, I have a bunch of questions about that.
[2116.42s -> 2118.42s]  So in that study,
[2118.42s -> 2121.42s]  there was no control group that didn't do resistance training.
[2121.42s -> 2124.42s]  The control group was resistance training
[2124.42s -> 2126.42s]  plus six minutes of walking.
[2126.42s -> 2128.42s]  Yes, six days of walking, correct.
[2128.42s -> 2131.42s]  Six days of walking, sorry, but with a placebo.
[2131.42s -> 2134.42s]  Both groups got calcium and vitamin D on a daily basis
[2134.42s -> 2137.42s]  to offset any of the bone-related issues.
[2137.42s -> 2141.42s]  Did bone mineral density improve, stay the same,
[2141.42s -> 2142.42s]  or go down?
[2142.42s -> 2144.42s]  I know there's no between-group differences,
[2144.42s -> 2147.42s]  but did both groups experience an improvement
[2147.42s -> 2150.42s]  or a reduction in bone mineral density
[2150.42s -> 2153.42s]  with the resistance training in place that they had?
[2153.42s -> 2157.42s]  Yeah, there was no overall change,
[2157.42s -> 2159.42s]  actually a slight reduction.
[2159.42s -> 2162.42s]  But again, bone mineral is so subjective to that,
[2162.42s -> 2165.42s]  but again, even with creatine.
[2165.42s -> 2168.42s]  So we now conclude that creatine does not increase
[2168.42s -> 2170.42s]  bone mineral density.
[2170.42s -> 2174.42s]  It may preserve the skeleton or make it a bit stronger,
[2174.42s -> 2176.42s]  but sort of the architecture,
[2176.42s -> 2179.42s]  because we measured trabecular and cortical bone before,
[2179.42s -> 2182.42s]  but measuring by DEXA or the aerial shell,
[2182.42s -> 2185.42s]  we're not seeing any increase in bone mineral.
[2185.42s -> 2188.42s]  It may help preserve the skeleton more than placebo.
[2188.42s -> 2192.42s]  Is that type of result with bone mineral density
[2192.42s -> 2195.42s]  with a resistance training program in place
[2195.42s -> 2199.42s]  consistent with the overall body of literature?
[2199.42s -> 2204.42s]  Yeah, unfortunately, our skeleton is super stubborn.
[2204.42s -> 2207.42s]  And when you look at even studies that just look at weight training,
[2207.42s -> 2210.42s]  you get a small increase in bone accrual.
[2210.42s -> 2214.42s]  It may only be as little as 1% to 3% over years.
[2214.42s -> 2218.42s]  So we don't really see a huge increase in bone mineral density
[2218.42s -> 2220.42s]  with the technology that we're using.
[2220.42s -> 2222.42s]  There's always standard error there,
[2222.42s -> 2225.42s]  not nearly as much as you get an increase in muscle mass.
[2225.42s -> 2228.42s]  And in terms of that training program,
[2228.42s -> 2232.42s]  I know from looking at some of the studies
[2232.42s -> 2236.42s]  that have attempted to improve bone mineral density
[2236.42s -> 2239.42s]  with different types of training interventions,
[2239.42s -> 2242.42s]  that resistance training is important,
[2242.42s -> 2249.42s]  but also kind of weight-bearing impact type exercise
[2249.42s -> 2251.42s]  like hopping or skipping or jogging
[2251.42s -> 2253.42s]  where the ground reaction force is greater
[2253.42s -> 2256.42s]  than you would be subjected to on a daily basis
[2256.42s -> 2258.42s]  also seems to be another stimulus
[2258.42s -> 2259.42s]  that's important.
[2259.42s -> 2261.42s]  Was that part of this?
[2261.42s -> 2264.42s]  Was this like a multimodal kind of exercise intervention
[2264.42s -> 2266.42s]  or was it pure resistance training?
[2266.42s -> 2268.42s]  Yeah, that's an excellent point.
[2268.42s -> 2270.42s]  It was actually just pure machine-based.
[2270.42s -> 2274.42s]  So there was multi-joint exercises,
[2274.42s -> 2277.42s]  but there was no plyometrics or box jumps and things like that.
[2277.42s -> 2279.42s]  And the walking was subjective.
[2279.42s -> 2281.42s]  They just walked as briskly at their own pace,
[2281.42s -> 2283.42s]  but that's an excellent point.
[2283.42s -> 2285.42s]  We now know bone will respond very well
[2285.42s -> 2287.42s]  to variety strains and vectors.
[2287.42s -> 2290.42s]  Complex training methods come into play,
[2290.42s -> 2293.42s]  but to the population, it's very difficult.
[2293.42s -> 2296.42s]  We're taking some special populations
[2296.42s -> 2298.42s]  with maybe some mobility issues there.
[2298.42s -> 2301.42s]  What could happen, that's a really good idea,
[2301.42s -> 2304.42s]  to do this maybe in young trained females
[2304.42s -> 2307.42s]  or young physically active females especially
[2307.42s -> 2310.42s]  who may be more prone or able to do that type of training
[2310.42s -> 2313.42s]  and maybe have some bone beneficial effects
[2313.42s -> 2315.42s]  and then we could extrapolate that to an older population.
[2315.42s -> 2316.42s]  So that's a very good idea.
[2317.42s -> 2320.42s]  You mentioned that there were some changes
[2320.42s -> 2324.42s]  to bone architecture and I think you said bone geometry.
[2324.42s -> 2326.42s]  Just to double-click on this,
[2326.42s -> 2329.42s]  what is the difference between bone mineral density,
[2329.42s -> 2332.42s]  which people will probably have heard of quite a lot
[2332.42s -> 2335.42s]  and many people have gone out and done a DEXA scan,
[2335.42s -> 2339.42s]  what's the difference between that and bone geometry?
[2339.42s -> 2341.42s]  Yeah, there's a huge difference.
[2341.42s -> 2343.42s]  So if your viewers have had a DEXA
[2343.42s -> 2345.42s]  or a body composition scan at the hospital,
[2345.42s -> 2347.42s]  basically, it's the same thing.
[2347.42s -> 2350.42s]  It's only measuring the aerial or the cylinder,
[2350.42s -> 2351.42s]  if you will, of the bone.
[2351.42s -> 2355.42s]  And so when we measure bone mineral density or content,
[2355.42s -> 2358.42s]  it's just simply measuring the weight of the bone.
[2358.42s -> 2362.42s]  Interestingly, with QCT or high resolution PQCT,
[2362.42s -> 2365.42s]  you can actually now separate what's inside the bone
[2365.42s -> 2367.42s]  from cortical and trabecular.
[2367.42s -> 2369.42s]  And we've shown actually using PQCT
[2369.42s -> 2372.42s]  that bone area primarily below the knee
[2372.42s -> 2376.42s]  did improve in males and females on creatine.
[2376.42s -> 2379.42s]  So it was actually having some additional lines of evidence
[2379.42s -> 2383.42s]  that the geometry or architecture sort of under or in the bone
[2383.42s -> 2386.42s]  was improving not just the shell of the bone,
[2386.42s -> 2388.42s]  so it's a little bit more scientific.
[2388.42s -> 2392.42s]  So in this two-year trial with postmenopausal women,
[2392.42s -> 2395.42s]  there were some changes to bone geometry
[2395.42s -> 2398.42s]  that are suggestive that that bone
[2398.42s -> 2401.42s]  may be able to withstand more force?
[2401.42s -> 2403.42s]  Yes, that's an excellent interpretation
[2403.42s -> 2405.42s]  because we did only use DEXA,
[2405.42s -> 2408.42s]  but then we used software around the hip region to predict.
[2408.42s -> 2411.42s]  Our previous study for one year,
[2411.42s -> 2413.42s]  we did see improvements using PQCT,
[2413.42s -> 2416.42s]  but a huge limitation of this two-year study
[2416.42s -> 2418.42s]  is we only used DEXA.
[2418.42s -> 2422.42s]  And so is there any interest in following these subjects for longer
[2422.42s -> 2426.42s]  or seeing how the changes in bone geometry
[2426.42s -> 2431.42s]  may translate to differences in fracture incidence?
[2431.42s -> 2433.42s]  Yeah, that's an excellent point.
[2433.42s -> 2434.42s]  If we get funding,
[2434.42s -> 2436.42s]  we're going to have to call back on these individuals
[2436.42s -> 2438.42s]  in five or 10 years especially.
[2438.42s -> 2441.42s]  And that's kind of when you would see the effectiveness.
[2441.42s -> 2443.42s]  And then you piggyback that off saying,
[2443.42s -> 2446.42s]  well, what about now we do studies in young females?
[2446.42s -> 2449.42s]  Maybe we can get the bone really large or strong
[2449.42s -> 2451.42s]  when they're 18, 19 years of age,
[2451.42s -> 2453.42s]  and maybe that'll offset the rate of bone mineral loss
[2453.42s -> 2455.42s]  as we get older.
[2455.42s -> 2459.42s]  So the theory or the myth that it's kind of never too early to work out,
[2459.42s -> 2462.42s]  young males and females should be exercising
[2462.42s -> 2464.42s]  and hopefully we can build up the body
[2464.42s -> 2466.42s]  that will offset the catastrophic effects
[2466.42s -> 2469.42s]  of sort of biological process of aging.
[2469.42s -> 2471.42s]  But there's a whole bunch of areas.
[2471.42s -> 2473.42s]  We have several studies planned.
[2473.42s -> 2475.42s]  And we're also thinking now,
[2475.42s -> 2477.42s]  what if we do the old, old age?
[2477.42s -> 2479.42s]  Like could creatine and exercise
[2479.42s -> 2482.42s]  have potential beneficial effects for 80 and above?
[2482.42s -> 2483.42s]  And we think it might.
[2483.42s -> 2486.42s]  The timing of the intervention is super interesting.
[2486.42s -> 2489.42s]  I remember reading a review
[2489.42s -> 2492.42s]  on bone mineral density
[2492.42s -> 2494.42s]  and postmenopausal women
[2494.42s -> 2496.42s]  and it spoke about the fact
[2496.42s -> 2500.42s]  that there seems to be quite a rapid loss of bone
[2500.42s -> 2504.42s]  in the first handful of years after menopause.
[2504.42s -> 2506.42s]  So if the average age of menopause,
[2506.42s -> 2510.42s]  I think it's about 51 or between 47 and 51.
[2510.42s -> 2513.42s]  And if I recall correctly,
[2513.42s -> 2516.42s]  the average woman could lose 5 to 7.5%
[2516.42s -> 2518.42s]  of their bone mineral density
[2518.42s -> 2521.42s]  in that first five-year period.
[2521.42s -> 2523.42s]  So I wonder, you know,
[2523.42s -> 2526.42s]  whether the effect of creatine
[2526.42s -> 2529.42s]  and the benefit could be dictated
[2529.42s -> 2531.42s]  by when you intervene.
[2531.42s -> 2536.42s]  So if you intervene when a woman is 51
[2536.42s -> 2540.42s]  versus intervening when she's 60
[2540.42s -> 2544.42s]  and already experienced that rapid bone loss,
[2544.42s -> 2547.42s]  would there be a difference in terms of outcome?
[2547.42s -> 2549.42s]  Yeah, that's exactly our line of thinking
[2549.42s -> 2552.42s]  to look at premenopausal versus perimenopausal.
[2553.42s -> 2555.42s]  And then it's very interesting.
[2555.42s -> 2558.42s]  Our participants had to wait 24 months
[2558.42s -> 2560.42s]  from the cessation of the last menstrual cycle.
[2560.42s -> 2563.42s]  So they were sort of well into the menopausal years.
[2563.42s -> 2564.42s]  But you're right.
[2564.42s -> 2567.42s]  What if we got it during the menopausal transition
[2567.42s -> 2570.42s]  into early menopause and late menopause?
[2570.42s -> 2573.42s]  So that's an area where we'd have to do a series of studies
[2573.42s -> 2575.42s]  with large sample sizes to sort of look at that.
[2575.42s -> 2577.42s]  My guess is you would have to sort of
[2577.42s -> 2579.42s]  piece together a number of studies
[2579.42s -> 2581.42s]  to come up with some foundational evidence.
[2581.42s -> 2582.42s]  Yeah.
[2582.42s -> 2585.42s]  So there was no difference in the bone mineral density
[2585.42s -> 2588.42s]  between the placebo and the creatine group
[2588.42s -> 2589.42s]  in the two-year study.
[2589.42s -> 2592.42s]  But from your earlier pilot study,
[2592.42s -> 2595.42s]  there was significant differences
[2595.42s -> 2597.42s]  in bone mineral density,
[2597.42s -> 2600.42s]  I think femoral neck from memory.
[2600.42s -> 2604.42s]  Why do you think that the two studies had different results?
[2604.42s -> 2607.42s]  Well, it's counterintuitive to what we think
[2607.42s -> 2609.42s]  because you would do long weight training
[2609.42s -> 2610.42s]  and a higher dose.
[2610.42s -> 2612.42s]  So we don't think any of those studies
[2612.42s -> 2613.42s]  played a role.
[2613.42s -> 2616.42s]  The big issue, we think, is statistical power.
[2616.42s -> 2619.42s]  Whereas the later study,
[2619.42s -> 2621.42s]  we had over 200 individuals.
[2621.42s -> 2623.42s]  In the first study, we only had over 30.
[2623.42s -> 2626.42s]  So the chance could have been by finding.
[2626.42s -> 2628.42s]  It was significant.
[2628.42s -> 2630.42s]  The effect size was low to moderate.
[2630.42s -> 2632.42s]  But it could be by chance of the people
[2632.42s -> 2634.42s]  that were randomized in that.
[2634.42s -> 2636.42s]  And that's kind of what we speculated.
[2636.42s -> 2640.42s]  And the changes in architecture,
[2640.42s -> 2642.42s]  from a mechanistic point of view,
[2642.42s -> 2645.42s]  you mentioned before that it has been thought
[2645.42s -> 2649.42s]  that creatine can increase muscle mass and strength
[2649.42s -> 2652.42s]  and that can then result on more force
[2652.42s -> 2654.42s]  being put through the skeleton.
[2654.42s -> 2657.42s]  You can lift a greater load.
[2657.42s -> 2659.42s]  Is that the primary mechanism
[2659.42s -> 2664.42s]  by which creatine is influencing bone architecture?
[2664.42s -> 2668.42s]  Or does creatine itself play a role
[2668.42s -> 2671.42s]  in bone tissue and affect osteoblasts
[2671.42s -> 2673.42s]  and osteoclasts,
[2673.42s -> 2676.42s]  these cells that are building and breaking down bone?
[2676.42s -> 2678.42s]  It's a great analogy.
[2678.42s -> 2681.42s]  We think it has a direct and indirect effect.
[2681.42s -> 2683.42s]  So let's go with the one you just mentioned,
[2683.42s -> 2684.42s]  the indirect.
[2684.42s -> 2687.42s]  So the theory is if creatine and resistance training
[2687.42s -> 2688.42s]  increases muscle mass,
[2688.42s -> 2690.42s]  muscle will pull on the bone.
[2690.42s -> 2692.42s]  And maybe that's some of the stimulating effects.
[2692.42s -> 2694.42s]  So that's an indirect way.
[2694.42s -> 2696.42s]  But there's actually some good cellular data
[2696.42s -> 2699.42s]  to suggest it actually has direct effects.
[2699.42s -> 2700.42s]  So as I alluded to,
[2700.42s -> 2702.42s]  that study in the early 2000s
[2702.42s -> 2704.42s]  simply showed that osteoblast cells
[2704.42s -> 2706.42s]  in the presence of creatine
[2706.42s -> 2708.42s]  sort of increased their activity.
[2708.42s -> 2709.42s]  And so the theory would be
[2709.42s -> 2712.42s]  if osteoblast cells have more activity
[2712.42s -> 2713.42s]  in the presence of calcium,
[2713.42s -> 2715.42s]  maybe they can sort of piece together
[2715.42s -> 2718.42s]  more skeleton or more calcium into your bone.
[2718.42s -> 2721.42s]  But we've actually shown now numerous times
[2721.42s -> 2723.42s]  creatine has been shown to decrease markers
[2723.42s -> 2725.42s]  of bone breakdown.
[2725.42s -> 2727.42s]  So these things called NTL peptides
[2727.42s -> 2729.42s]  or markers of collagen breakdown.
[2729.42s -> 2731.42s]  So creatine has been shown now in several studies
[2731.42s -> 2732.42s]  in young and older adults
[2732.42s -> 2735.42s]  to reduce collagen breakdown.
[2735.42s -> 2736.42s]  So you could say,
[2736.42s -> 2739.42s]  okay, we might have some benefits with osteoblasts.
[2739.42s -> 2742.42s]  Now we might actually preserve bone breakdown.
[2742.42s -> 2744.42s]  It's kind of like a bisphosphonate,
[2744.42s -> 2745.42s]  not nearly at the same level,
[2745.42s -> 2746.42s]  but that's the theory.
[2746.42s -> 2748.42s]  So when you get the balance,
[2748.42s -> 2752.42s]  maybe the bone could have a greater integrity over time.
[2752.42s -> 2755.42s]  So even though the kind of,
[2755.42s -> 2757.42s]  I guess the results with regards to bone health
[2757.42s -> 2758.42s]  are not clear cut,
[2758.42s -> 2760.42s]  at the moment,
[2760.42s -> 2763.42s]  there's some signal.
[2763.42s -> 2766.42s]  We don't have long term studies
[2766.42s -> 2768.42s]  that look at the hard outcomes
[2768.42s -> 2770.42s]  like fractures themselves.
[2770.42s -> 2773.42s]  But I'm assuming that your position,
[2773.42s -> 2774.42s]  and correct me if I'm wrong,
[2774.42s -> 2777.42s]  is that because of the benefits for lean mass,
[2777.42s -> 2780.42s]  potentially motor coordination
[2780.42s -> 2783.42s]  and the safety profile that you spoke to,
[2783.42s -> 2786.42s]  that creatine would still be worth supplementing
[2786.42s -> 2788.42s]  to try and reduce our bone growth.
[2788.42s -> 2790.42s]  And even if it's not,
[2790.42s -> 2792.42s]  will it help our risk of fractures as we age?
[2792.42s -> 2794.42s]  Even if the effects on bone strength
[2794.42s -> 2796.42s]  are somewhat debatable at this point.
[2796.42s -> 2798.42s]  Yeah, I think it's something to consider
[2798.42s -> 2800.42s]  on top of the resistance training cake,
[2800.42s -> 2801.42s]  because as you just said,
[2801.42s -> 2804.42s]  it has been shown to do this in some studies.
[2804.42s -> 2806.42s]  The other big thing is our colleagues in Brazil
[2806.42s -> 2810.42s]  have not shown any bone effects without exercise.
[2810.42s -> 2811.42s]  So this is important.
[2811.42s -> 2812.42s]  If you're taking creatine
[2812.42s -> 2815.42s]  and you're expecting to get these magical powers,
[2815.42s -> 2816.42s]  it's not going to happen.
[2816.42s -> 2817.42s]  You need to do some form of exercise.
[2817.42s -> 2820.42s]  And the dose seems to be higher.
[2820.42s -> 2822.42s]  They looked at one in three grams a day
[2822.42s -> 2823.42s]  for up to two years
[2823.42s -> 2824.42s]  and they found no effects.
[2824.42s -> 2826.42s]  The dose we've given
[2826.42s -> 2828.42s]  and other labs have given is higher.
[2828.42s -> 2831.42s]  So it seems to be a little bit higher with exercise
[2831.42s -> 2833.42s]  and you may be able to get some greater effects.
[2833.42s -> 2836.42s]  And if that decreases the risk of falls
[2836.42s -> 2837.42s]  or improves ability
[2837.42s -> 2839.42s]  or more importantly,
[2839.42s -> 2841.42s]  decreases fractures,
[2841.42s -> 2843.42s]  that's something to at least consider.
[2843.42s -> 2845.42s]  What about brain function?
[2845.42s -> 2847.42s]  You've mentioned a concern
[2847.42s -> 2848.42s]  a couple of times
[2848.42s -> 2851.42s]  that the dosing for various aspects
[2851.42s -> 2853.42s]  of brain function and cognition
[2853.42s -> 2856.42s]  may be different to the dosing
[2856.42s -> 2857.42s]  that we would use
[2857.42s -> 2862.42s]  for increasing creatine levels in muscle tissue.
[2862.42s -> 2864.42s]  What's the latest with regards
[2864.42s -> 2867.42s]  to the role of creatine in our brain?
[2867.42s -> 2869.42s]  Yeah, I think this is why creatine
[2869.42s -> 2871.42s]  has become so popular all of a sudden,
[2871.42s -> 2873.42s]  the brain and the bone effects.
[2873.42s -> 2875.42s]  So about a decade ago,
[2875.42s -> 2877.42s]  it was clearly shown that creatine
[2877.42s -> 2879.42s]  can accumulate in the brain.
[2879.42s -> 2881.42s]  It can get past the blood-brain barrier.
[2881.42s -> 2883.42s]  It's not rarely easily
[2883.42s -> 2885.42s]  and it can still accumulate.
[2885.42s -> 2887.42s]  And again, a lot of viewers may not know this,
[2887.42s -> 2889.42s]  but the brain actually makes its own creatine
[2889.42s -> 2891.42s]  just like the liver.
[2891.42s -> 2892.42s]  So the brain says,
[2892.42s -> 2893.42s]  hey, wait a minute,
[2893.42s -> 2894.42s]  I'm making my own creatine.
[2894.42s -> 2896.42s]  I don't like a lot of things getting in
[2896.42s -> 2897.42s]  past the endothelial cells
[2897.42s -> 2898.42s]  and the blood-brain barrier.
[2898.42s -> 2901.42s]  So maybe it's going to need a higher dose.
[2901.42s -> 2902.42s]  And sure enough,
[2902.42s -> 2905.42s]  there's probably only been 13 studies
[2905.42s -> 2906.42s]  to my count
[2906.42s -> 2908.42s]  that have looked at creatine
[2908.42s -> 2910.42s]  and measuring brain creatine content.
[2910.42s -> 2912.42s]  And there's two schools of thought.
[2912.42s -> 2914.42s]  You need a much higher dose,
[2914.42s -> 2916.42s]  about 20 grams,
[2916.42s -> 2919.42s]  or you can take a lower dose
[2919.42s -> 2920.42s]  as we've talked about,
[2920.42s -> 2921.42s]  but it seems like you need it
[2921.42s -> 2922.42s]  for months on end.
[2922.42s -> 2925.42s]  And probably based on endogenous synthesis
[2925.42s -> 2927.42s]  or that blood-brain barrier,
[2927.42s -> 2929.42s]  maybe you need higher dosages
[2929.42s -> 2931.42s]  or longer to accumulate in the brain.
[2931.42s -> 2933.42s]  And that's why a lot of the studies
[2933.42s -> 2935.42s]  on brain are so interesting.
[2935.42s -> 2939.42s]  These individuals that may be having concussion
[2939.42s -> 2941.42s]  or depression
[2941.42s -> 2943.42s]  are maybe now looking at creatine
[2943.42s -> 2946.42s]  to help as one potential strategy
[2946.42s -> 2948.42s]  to overcome some of these ailments.
[2948.42s -> 2951.42s]  So I think the brain is the hottest topic.
[2951.42s -> 2953.42s]  We published a really elegant review this year
[2953.42s -> 2955.42s]  looking at all the studies
[2955.42s -> 2956.42s]  that have looked at it
[2956.42s -> 2958.42s]  from first getting in the brain
[2958.42s -> 2960.42s]  and then on concussion, depression,
[2960.42s -> 2963.42s]  neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's,
[2963.42s -> 2965.42s]  multiple sclerosis.
[2965.42s -> 2966.42s]  So there's a huge area.
[2966.42s -> 2969.42s]  My guess is the next 20 or 30 years
[2969.42s -> 2971.42s]  will primarily be focused on
[2971.42s -> 2973.42s]  cognitive or brain effects.
[2973.42s -> 2975.42s]  Why do you think a higher dose
[2975.42s -> 2979.42s]  is required in order to get brain levels
[2979.42s -> 2981.42s]  of creatine to increase?
[2981.42s -> 2984.42s]  Is it that the creatine that we ingest
[2984.42s -> 2987.42s]  first and foremost has to saturate muscle cells
[2987.42s -> 2990.42s]  and it's only once those are saturated
[2990.42s -> 2992.42s]  that there's enough creatine available?
[2993.42s -> 2995.42s]  To go across the blood-brain barrier?
[2995.42s -> 2996.42s]  Yeah, you're one of the rare
[2996.42s -> 2998.42s]  that kind of gets it when that.
[2998.42s -> 2999.42s]  I usually am interested
[2999.42s -> 3001.42s]  when people sort of say,
[3001.42s -> 3002.42s]  why does it take more?
[3002.42s -> 3004.42s]  But you've hit the nail on the head.
[3004.42s -> 3006.42s]  So remember 95% of the creatine
[3006.42s -> 3008.42s]  that we either synthesize or ingest
[3008.42s -> 3010.42s]  will go and be stored in your muscle.
[3010.42s -> 3011.42s]  So the argument is,
[3011.42s -> 3013.42s]  well, geez, you're going to have trickle amounts
[3013.42s -> 3015.42s]  going to other tissues such as the brain.
[3015.42s -> 3016.42s]  And so that maybe that's why
[3016.42s -> 3018.42s]  we needed higher dosages.
[3018.42s -> 3019.42s]  And then you would further argue,
[3019.42s -> 3021.42s]  wow, the brain is very protective.
[3021.42s -> 3023.42s]  It doesn't like the Lao creatine anymore.
[3023.42s -> 3025.42s]  Because it makes its own.
[3025.42s -> 3026.42s]  So maybe that's why
[3026.42s -> 3028.42s]  it only seems to be effective
[3028.42s -> 3031.42s]  in compromised populations
[3031.42s -> 3034.42s]  such as sleep deprivation, hypoxia
[3034.42s -> 3036.42s]  or depression or concussion.
[3036.42s -> 3038.42s]  A common denominator
[3038.42s -> 3039.42s]  when you look at the studies
[3039.42s -> 3040.42s]  that have the magnets
[3040.42s -> 3042.42s]  to measure brain creatine,
[3042.42s -> 3044.42s]  a common denominator in those studies
[3044.42s -> 3046.42s]  is that those clinical populations
[3046.42s -> 3048.42s]  have reduced creatine stores
[3048.42s -> 3050.42s]  compared to healthy controls.
[3050.42s -> 3052.42s]  So maybe creatine is just being allowed
[3052.42s -> 3053.42s]  to come in because the brain says,
[3053.42s -> 3054.42s]  I need your help.
[3054.42s -> 3057.42s]  Or it's just bringing levels back up to normal.
[3057.42s -> 3060.42s]  What I would hope is it elevates it more
[3060.42s -> 3061.42s]  because the brain tissue,
[3061.42s -> 3062.42s]  just like your muscle,
[3062.42s -> 3065.42s]  uses creatine to maintain ATP.
[3065.42s -> 3068.42s]  But it also seems to reduce inflammation.
[3068.42s -> 3070.42s]  And one of the things you would speculate
[3070.42s -> 3072.42s]  with traumatic brain injury concussion
[3072.42s -> 3074.42s]  is the brain is kind of inflamed.
[3074.42s -> 3076.42s]  So one of the main mechanisms in the brain
[3076.42s -> 3079.42s]  is reducing oxidative stress or inflammation.
[3079.42s -> 3082.42s]  So there's some elegant labs in the world
[3082.42s -> 3084.42s]  like Serge Ostiak in Norway,
[3084.42s -> 3087.42s]  Bruno Gualiano and Hamilton Rochelle in Brazil.
[3087.42s -> 3089.42s]  They're doing some phenomenal research
[3089.42s -> 3092.42s]  trying to look at the clinical aspects of creatine.
[3092.42s -> 3095.42s]  Yeah, I've had Hamilton Rochelle
[3095.42s -> 3097.42s]  on the show once before.
[3097.42s -> 3099.42s]  He's a bit of a crowd favorite.
[3099.42s -> 3100.42s]  What can we make,
[3100.42s -> 3104.42s]  is there any significance
[3104.42s -> 3108.42s]  in the fact that vegetarians and vegans,
[3108.42s -> 3109.42s]  if I'm correct,
[3109.42s -> 3111.42s]  tend to have the same levels
[3111.42s -> 3115.42s]  of brain creatine to omnivores,
[3115.42s -> 3119.42s]  but have half or less the level of creatine
[3119.42s -> 3120.42s]  in muscle cells?
[3120.42s -> 3121.42s]  Yeah, and that was clearly shown
[3121.42s -> 3123.42s]  with Hamilton and Bruno's study.
[3123.42s -> 3126.42s]  So I love that segue because the theory is,
[3126.42s -> 3127.42s]  well, how is it different?
[3127.42s -> 3129.42s]  And I'm like, well, it's quite different.
[3129.42s -> 3131.42s]  We now know that if you just look at vegetarians
[3131.42s -> 3133.42s]  versus an omnivore,
[3133.42s -> 3135.42s]  the vegetarians have way lower creatine
[3135.42s -> 3136.42s]  in their muscle.
[3136.42s -> 3138.42s]  But you would also speculate,
[3138.42s -> 3140.42s]  why isn't it that it must be the same in the brain
[3140.42s -> 3141.42s]  and it's not?
[3141.42s -> 3144.42s]  So that blood brain barrier is very protective.
[3144.42s -> 3146.42s]  And remember, the vegan brain
[3146.42s -> 3148.42s]  and the omnivore brain is producing creatine.
[3148.42s -> 3150.42s]  So it is interesting that the muscle
[3150.42s -> 3151.42s]  is totally different.
[3151.42s -> 3154.42s]  The brain levels seem to be very stable
[3154.42s -> 3157.42s]  across habitual dietary preference,
[3157.42s -> 3158.42s]  whereas the muscle is not.
[3158.42s -> 3160.42s]  And then again, that opens the door,
[3160.42s -> 3161.42s]  is it different in bone?
[3161.42s -> 3163.42s]  We don't know that as well.
[3163.42s -> 3165.42s]  Is there any significance
[3165.42s -> 3169.42s]  to the form of creatine in our body
[3169.42s -> 3171.42s]  or how it's stored?
[3171.42s -> 3174.42s]  My understanding is that some of it is bound to phosphate
[3174.42s -> 3179.42s]  and then some of the creatine is free creatine.
[3179.42s -> 3181.42s]  Is there any significance to that
[3181.42s -> 3185.42s]  and differences between different populations
[3185.42s -> 3188.42s]  or people that are healthy or unhealthy?
[3188.42s -> 3190.42s]  Yeah, the amount of creatine coming in
[3190.42s -> 3193.42s]  or synthesized is basically into two things.
[3193.42s -> 3195.42s]  So when you hear total creatine,
[3195.42s -> 3197.42s]  it's this phosphorylated compound.
[3197.42s -> 3199.42s]  And then, of course, you have free creatine.
[3199.42s -> 3203.42s]  And actually, it's a reversible equation
[3203.42s -> 3205.42s]  or reaction that occurs in two areas of the cell,
[3205.42s -> 3207.42s]  the mitochondria and the cytoplasm.
[3207.42s -> 3210.42s]  And they just reverse based on activity
[3210.42s -> 3211.42s]  or diet and things like that.
[3211.42s -> 3214.42s]  And about 66% of creatine
[3214.42s -> 3216.42s]  is in the form of fossil creatine
[3216.42s -> 3218.42s]  and the remaining third is free creatine.
[3218.42s -> 3220.42s]  And they can cycle back and forth,
[3220.42s -> 3222.42s]  but it's the fossil creatine
[3222.42s -> 3223.42s]  that we're really focused on
[3223.42s -> 3226.42s]  because it donates that phosphate group,
[3226.42s -> 3228.42s]  if you will, to maintain ATP during exercise.
[3229.42s -> 3231.42s]  We're thinking about trying to increase
[3231.42s -> 3235.42s]  creatine levels in the brain.
[3235.42s -> 3241.42s]  I've read a few people who have written about this
[3241.42s -> 3245.42s]  that seem to suggest that glycosiamine,
[3245.42s -> 3247.42s]  I think that's how you pronounce it,
[3247.42s -> 3249.42s]  a precursor to creatine,
[3249.42s -> 3252.42s]  this might be a more effective way
[3252.42s -> 3254.42s]  of increasing brain creatine.
[3254.42s -> 3256.42s]  Is that true or something that you've come across?
[3256.42s -> 3258.42s]  Yeah, it's guanidinoacetate,
[3258.42s -> 3260.42s]  acetic acid is GAA,
[3260.42s -> 3262.42s]  and a good colleague of mine
[3262.42s -> 3264.42s]  has kind of pioneered this with a patent.
[3264.42s -> 3266.42s]  And they've shown that these precursors
[3266.42s -> 3269.42s]  can sort of squeak through the blood-brain barrier.
[3269.42s -> 3270.42s]  They resemble creatine,
[3270.42s -> 3273.42s]  so that's why they're allowed to get through the doorway.
[3273.42s -> 3275.42s]  And they seem to be able to squeak through
[3275.42s -> 3278.42s]  and accumulate a little bit easier.
[3278.42s -> 3280.42s]  The argument is, well,
[3280.42s -> 3281.42s]  the brain will make creatine
[3281.42s -> 3283.42s]  and may not make this analog.
[3283.42s -> 3285.42s]  So that's why it's allowed to be taken in
[3285.42s -> 3287.42s]  and it can have some beneficial effects.
[3287.42s -> 3290.42s]  There's some preliminary data to suggest that as well,
[3290.42s -> 3293.42s]  but we don't know if it improves performance
[3293.42s -> 3295.42s]  or has the health outcome measures the same,
[3295.42s -> 3297.42s]  so they need to have some comparison studies
[3297.42s -> 3298.42s]  with that as well.
[3298.42s -> 3300.42s]  So where are you at today,
[3300.42s -> 3302.42s]  I guess with regards to maybe,
[3302.42s -> 3304.42s]  if you don't mind commenting,
[3304.42s -> 3308.42s]  your own personal kind of dosing strategy for creatine?
[3308.42s -> 3310.42s]  Is that based off of the literature
[3310.42s -> 3314.42s]  looking at muscle mass and bone health
[3314.42s -> 3317.42s]  and the kind of 0.1 or 0.14,
[3317.42s -> 3320.42s]  grams per kilogram that we spoke about before?
[3320.42s -> 3323.42s]  Or are you also seeing signal
[3323.42s -> 3326.42s]  in the literature looking at cognition
[3326.42s -> 3328.42s]  and long-term brain health
[3328.42s -> 3330.42s]  in some of these studies
[3330.42s -> 3333.42s]  where it seems that you need to use a higher dose?
[3333.42s -> 3334.42s]  Yeah, and it's changed.
[3334.42s -> 3336.42s]  Before we knew about the bone and brain
[3336.42s -> 3338.42s]  and even the immune system,
[3338.42s -> 3340.42s]  it was simply three to five grams a day
[3340.42s -> 3342.42s]  and of course everybody was happy
[3342.42s -> 3344.42s]  and you're getting a lot of benefits.
[3344.42s -> 3345.42s]  And then you look at the,
[3345.42s -> 3346.42s]  as I get older
[3346.42s -> 3347.42s]  and the population gets older,
[3347.42s -> 3349.42s]  the bone importance
[3349.42s -> 3350.42s]  and then of course the brain.
[3350.42s -> 3351.42s]  And so when I did the math,
[3351.42s -> 3353.42s]  three to five grams for muscle,
[3353.42s -> 3355.42s]  about eight to 10 for bone
[3355.42s -> 3358.42s]  and then on average is about 20 or longer.
[3358.42s -> 3360.42s]  So I've been taking about 10 grams a day
[3360.42s -> 3362.42s]  for the last two years.
[3362.42s -> 3363.42s]  I also take that for potentially
[3363.42s -> 3365.42s]  some of the anti-inflammatory effects.
[3365.42s -> 3368.42s]  When you go to these aging sarcopenia conferences,
[3368.42s -> 3370.42s]  one of the big hallmarks of aging
[3370.42s -> 3372.42s]  is this chronic low grade inflammation
[3372.42s -> 3374.42s]  we're having all day.
[3374.42s -> 3375.42s]  And I think as we get older,
[3375.42s -> 3378.42s]  we say, geez, my aches and pains are there
[3378.42s -> 3380.42s]  compared to a younger individual.
[3380.42s -> 3383.42s]  So I take about 10 grams a day.
[3383.42s -> 3384.42s]  I can take even more.
[3384.42s -> 3386.42s]  And of course, if I have an excess,
[3386.42s -> 3389.42s]  I might just excrete it in my urine.
[3389.42s -> 3391.42s]  So I'm fine with that.
[3391.42s -> 3393.42s]  But the days that you forget or whichever,
[3393.42s -> 3395.42s]  it accumulates.
[3395.42s -> 3399.42s]  The other thing is once the muscle is saturated,
[3399.42s -> 3401.42s]  it probably takes at least a month
[3401.42s -> 3403.42s]  for those levels to come back to baseline.
[3403.42s -> 3405.42s]  And I've talked to some brain researchers
[3405.42s -> 3409.42s]  and we theorize it's five weeks in the brain.
[3409.42s -> 3412.42s]  So if you go on vacation or you miss your creatine,
[3412.42s -> 3414.42s]  you don't have to freak out.
[3414.42s -> 3416.42s]  You could either have a serving of seafood
[3416.42s -> 3419.42s]  or red meat or it's still going to be there.
[3419.42s -> 3421.42s]  Activity will help maintain that
[3421.42s -> 3424.42s]  because it helps maintain type two muscle fibers.
[3424.42s -> 3426.42s]  So that's some of the interesting things.
[3426.42s -> 3427.42s]  And the other nice thing with this
[3427.42s -> 3429.42s]  is the timing is irrelevant.
[3429.42s -> 3432.42s]  You can take creatine at any time of the day.
[3432.42s -> 3434.42s]  I wouldn't go any lower than one gram
[3434.42s -> 3436.42s]  servings because in 1992,
[3436.42s -> 3438.42s]  that dose just wasn't high enough
[3438.42s -> 3440.42s]  to accumulate in the blood.
[3440.42s -> 3442.42s]  I think maybe three is probably the lowest amount,
[3442.42s -> 3444.42s]  maybe even two.
[3444.42s -> 3446.42s]  You can break that up into multiple servings
[3446.42s -> 3448.42s]  throughout the day
[3448.42s -> 3450.42s]  or you can take it in one bowl.
[3450.42s -> 3452.42s]  So it's not like it's probably similar
[3452.42s -> 3454.42s]  in theory to protein,
[3454.42s -> 3456.42s]  but you need so much protein throughout the day.
[3456.42s -> 3458.42s]  You're always conscious of it.
[3458.42s -> 3461.42s]  I think creatine is something that you can just sort of take.
[3461.42s -> 3463.42s]  The consistency is there.
[3463.42s -> 3466.42s]  Multiple times a day, once a day, whichever you like,
[3466.42s -> 3468.42s]  and see the effects.
[3468.42s -> 3471.42s]  Is there a clinical indication
[3471.42s -> 3474.42s]  or is the research too preliminary
[3474.42s -> 3477.42s]  for going above 10 grams a day
[3477.42s -> 3479.42s]  towards that 20 grams a day
[3479.42s -> 3482.42s]  for particular cognitive benefits?
[3482.42s -> 3485.42s]  Is there a way for people to know,
[3485.42s -> 3487.42s]  if someone's listening and thinking,
[3487.42s -> 3489.42s]  okay, my brain makes creatine,
[3489.42s -> 3491.42s]  but I want to know if it's making enough.
[3491.42s -> 3492.42s]  Am I someone
[3492.42s -> 3496.42s]  who has suboptimal levels of creatine in my brain
[3496.42s -> 3498.42s]  and therefore I would benefit
[3498.42s -> 3500.42s]  from having a 20 gram a day dose
[3500.42s -> 3502.42s]  such that I would saturate my muscle cells
[3502.42s -> 3505.42s]  and then hopefully increase brain creatine as well?
[3505.42s -> 3506.42s]  No, as it stands right now,
[3506.42s -> 3508.42s]  it's all speculation
[3508.42s -> 3512.42s]  based on kind of extrapolating pieces of the puzzle.
[3512.42s -> 3513.42s]  So individuals, unfortunately,
[3513.42s -> 3516.42s]  can be born with grain deficiency syndrome
[3516.42s -> 3519.42s]  and those individuals respond very well to a small dose.
[3519.42s -> 3521.42s]  But we just published a study this year
[3521.42s -> 3524.42s]  looking at dosing 10 grams versus 20
[3524.42s -> 3526.42s]  on cognitive performance.
[3526.42s -> 3528.42s]  We saw no difference between the dosages,
[3528.42s -> 3531.42s]  but these were in young, healthy individuals.
[3531.42s -> 3534.42s]  So my thought on cognition has changed a bit.
[3534.42s -> 3537.42s]  If you're a healthy individual, adequate sleep,
[3537.42s -> 3539.42s]  you're not having any major stressors in your life,
[3539.42s -> 3541.42s]  I don't think you're going to experience
[3541.42s -> 3543.42s]  any benefits from creatine.
[3543.42s -> 3545.42s]  The studies that seem to show benefits
[3545.42s -> 3547.42s]  are in those that are sleep deprived.
[3547.42s -> 3550.42s]  Maybe jet lag would fall into that category as well.
[3550.42s -> 3554.42s]  Hypoxia or chronic conditions
[3554.42s -> 3557.42s]  such as maybe concussion syndrome.
[3557.42s -> 3559.42s]  Those are the things that we think
[3559.42s -> 3561.42s]  might have some application.
[3561.42s -> 3563.42s]  But for the healthy person,
[3563.42s -> 3565.42s]  they say, geez, I sleep well.
[3565.42s -> 3567.42s]  My weight is stable.
[3567.42s -> 3569.42s]  I can exercise.
[3569.42s -> 3572.42s]  I don't think you're going to get any noticeable effects.
[3572.42s -> 3574.42s]  It's kind of only in clinical populations.
[3574.42s -> 3577.42s]  And to that point, only in certain ones.
[3577.42s -> 3579.42s]  We're not seeing any benefits in Parkinson's.
[3579.42s -> 3581.42s]  Alzheimer's.
[3581.42s -> 3583.42s]  We see some in muscular dystrophy
[3583.42s -> 3585.42s]  in young boys with that condition.
[3585.42s -> 3587.42s]  We don't really see any in people
[3587.42s -> 3589.42s]  with multiple sclerosis either.
[3589.42s -> 3592.42s]  Maybe long-term clinical trials have to be there.
[3592.42s -> 3594.42s]  It is showing some promise in people
[3594.42s -> 3596.42s]  with diagnosed depression.
[3596.42s -> 3598.42s]  And again, a clinical marker there
[3598.42s -> 3600.42s]  is that they have reduced creatine stores
[3600.42s -> 3602.42s]  in certain areas of the brain.
[3602.42s -> 3604.42s]  And then when creatine is given
[3604.42s -> 3606.42s]  in combination with medication,
[3606.42s -> 3608.42s]  no study has ever looked at creatine
[3608.42s -> 3610.42s]  without medication.
[3610.42s -> 3611.42s]  So that's really important.
[3611.42s -> 3612.42s]  And never come off your medication
[3612.42s -> 3613.42s]  for those listening.
[3613.42s -> 3615.42s]  Always get medical clearance.
[3615.42s -> 3618.42s]  Creatine has been shown to have some small favorable effects
[3618.42s -> 3620.42s]  in anxiety and depression.
[3620.42s -> 3622.42s]  So those are the areas that are emerging.
[3622.42s -> 3624.42s]  And there's only been one study
[3624.42s -> 3626.42s]  in children with concussion.
[3626.42s -> 3629.42s]  And that's an area that seems to be the biggest focus.
[3629.42s -> 3632.42s]  How are they measuring the creatine stores
[3632.42s -> 3635.42s]  in the brain in those studies?
[3635.42s -> 3637.42s]  I'm assuming that's not something that you can
[3637.42s -> 3639.42s]  you can access.
[3639.42s -> 3641.42s]  It's kind of like an MRI for the brain
[3641.42s -> 3643.42s]  with magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
[3643.42s -> 3646.42s]  There's only a few universities that have the magnet.
[3646.42s -> 3648.42s]  It's super expensive.
[3648.42s -> 3650.42s]  And that's how you would measure this.
[3650.42s -> 3652.42s]  You're not going to do the brain biopsy.
[3652.42s -> 3654.42s]  So that's how you measure the uptake.
[3654.42s -> 3656.42s]  And that's another big area.
[3656.42s -> 3658.42s]  Just like muscle, we kind of always want to know
[3658.42s -> 3660.42s]  how much you have to start with.
[3660.42s -> 3663.42s]  So maybe some of the variability in these studies
[3663.42s -> 3665.42s]  is we don't know how much you have to start in the brain.
[3665.42s -> 3667.42s]  We don't know the rate that it's natural.
[3667.42s -> 3669.42s]  We don't know if you're actually making it.
[3669.42s -> 3671.42s]  So that's why I think the next 20 or 30 years
[3671.42s -> 3674.42s]  we'll have to focus on advanced technology in the brain.
[3674.42s -> 3676.42s]  And then we got to look at the areas of the brain,
[3676.42s -> 3678.42s]  the white matter and the gray matter.
[3678.42s -> 3680.42s]  Is there differences?
[3680.42s -> 3682.42s]  Is there differences in healthy people
[3682.42s -> 3685.42s]  versus head trauma or depression?
[3685.42s -> 3688.42s]  Again, I think it's going to be the huge focal area.
[3688.42s -> 3691.42s]  Hopefully more money is put into research funding
[3691.42s -> 3693.42s]  in those areas.
[3693.42s -> 3695.42s]  Hey friends, if you'd like to stay connected
[3695.42s -> 3698.42s]  and reinforce the valuable insights from this show,
[3698.42s -> 3700.42s]  let's connect on Instagram.
[3700.42s -> 3702.42s]  You can find me at Simon Hill.
[3702.42s -> 3704.42s]  That's at Simon Hill.
[3704.42s -> 3706.42s]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[3706.42s -> 3708.42s]  All right, let's dive back into the episode.
[3708.42s -> 3712.42s]  What about creatine supplementation during pregnancy
[3712.42s -> 3714.42s]  and or breastfeeding?
[3714.42s -> 3718.42s]  I think I read a review a few years back
[3718.42s -> 3723.42s]  that it was looking more broadly at women and safety.
[3723.42s -> 3725.42s]  And the conclusion from that,
[3725.42s -> 3728.42s]  was that across the board,
[3728.42s -> 3731.42s]  creatine supplementation in women
[3731.42s -> 3733.42s]  appeared to be very safe.
[3733.42s -> 3737.42s]  There was no serious adverse effects.
[3737.42s -> 3740.42s]  But there was some commentary around
[3740.42s -> 3742.42s]  maybe a lack of data
[3742.42s -> 3744.42s]  looking at creatine supplementation
[3744.42s -> 3746.42s]  during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
[3746.42s -> 3748.42s]  Is that something that you've looked at?
[3748.42s -> 3751.42s]  Yeah, it's probably the most novel area of speculation.
[3751.42s -> 3752.42s]  And you'll be happy with this,
[3752.42s -> 3754.42s]  but Stacey Ellery in Australia
[3754.42s -> 3756.42s]  is probably the world's leader in this area.
[3756.42s -> 3758.42s]  And so she just two days ago
[3758.42s -> 3760.42s]  put out another study and review,
[3760.42s -> 3762.42s]  and they've looked at animal model with pregnancy
[3762.42s -> 3764.42s]  and in potentially humans.
[3764.42s -> 3766.42s]  And when I talked to Stacey,
[3766.42s -> 3768.42s]  it's lots of caution here.
[3768.42s -> 3769.42s]  So first off,
[3769.42s -> 3771.42s]  if you're pregnant, thinking of pregnancy,
[3771.42s -> 3773.42s]  fetus, whichever development,
[3773.42s -> 3774.42s]  always speak to your doctor.
[3774.42s -> 3776.42s]  But the existing data
[3776.42s -> 3779.42s]  has shown potential benefits for fetal development,
[3779.42s -> 3783.42s]  lack or decrease in complications during the pregnancy,
[3783.42s -> 3785.42s]  and potentially maintaining
[3785.42s -> 3788.42s]  some of the energy bioenergetics during pregnancy for the female.
[3788.42s -> 3790.42s]  We don't think creatine is transported
[3790.42s -> 3792.42s]  or transferred to breast milk,
[3792.42s -> 3795.42s]  but that's an area that needs to be looked at a little bit more.
[3795.42s -> 3797.42s]  But as it stands,
[3797.42s -> 3799.42s]  and this is my understanding,
[3799.42s -> 3801.42s]  creatine has some potential beneficial effects
[3801.42s -> 3803.42s]  for not only the fetus, but the mother.
[3803.42s -> 3806.42s]  The dose is typically usually lower,
[3806.42s -> 3808.42s]  a lower dose, three to five grams.
[3808.42s -> 3812.42s]  But severe caution needs to be considered.
[3812.42s -> 3814.42s]  Please talk to your doctor.
[3814.42s -> 3817.42s]  And again, more safety aspects need to be there.
[3817.42s -> 3820.42s]  We're not really seeing any adverse effects,
[3820.42s -> 3822.42s]  maybe a little bit of weight gain,
[3822.42s -> 3824.42s]  but we're not seeing any huge detrimental effects
[3824.42s -> 3825.42s]  as it currently stands.
[3825.42s -> 3827.42s]  And I could echo that exact same analogy
[3827.42s -> 3829.42s]  for creatine in children.
[3829.42s -> 3830.42s]  It's the same thing.
[3830.42s -> 3832.42s]  It's very beneficial.
[3832.42s -> 3833.42s]  We're not seeing any adverse effects,
[3833.42s -> 3836.42s]  but we need to do more blood biomarkers there as well.
[3836.42s -> 3837.42s]  Yeah, I think that's interesting.
[3837.42s -> 3839.42s]  I think a number of parents
[3839.42s -> 3842.42s]  are probably a bit fearful.
[3842.42s -> 3844.42s]  Of giving their children creatine
[3844.42s -> 3848.42s]  or have been kind of made to feel fearful.
[3848.42s -> 3849.42s]  I kind of use the analogy,
[3849.42s -> 3851.42s]  it's kind of no different than eating protein.
[3851.42s -> 3853.42s]  If you give chicken or salmon
[3853.42s -> 3855.42s]  or red meat to your child,
[3855.42s -> 3858.42s]  creatine is recognized by the body at a lower dose.
[3858.42s -> 3860.42s]  And all the studies that have looked at
[3860.42s -> 3861.42s]  regular dosing patterns,
[3861.42s -> 3863.42s]  it's been shown to be very safe.
[3863.42s -> 3866.42s]  No adverse effects or no greater adverse effects
[3866.42s -> 3867.42s]  compared to placebo.
[3867.42s -> 3869.42s]  And two good colleagues of mine in the US
[3869.42s -> 3871.42s]  are looking at blood biomarkers now.
[3871.42s -> 3872.42s]  And my guess is,
[3872.42s -> 3874.42s]  it's not going to have any adverse effects
[3874.42s -> 3876.42s]  because it's naturally produced.
[3876.42s -> 3878.42s]  Our body recognizes it.
[3878.42s -> 3880.42s]  And it'll probably have the same benefits,
[3880.42s -> 3883.42s]  if anything, similar to protein or carbohydrate
[3883.42s -> 3885.42s]  that's coming into the child's diet.
[3885.42s -> 3888.42s]  Did Stacey Ellery's review
[3888.42s -> 3889.42s]  that you mentioned there
[3889.42s -> 3891.42s]  that she published a couple of days ago
[3891.42s -> 3895.42s]  that spoke to potential benefits during pregnancy,
[3895.42s -> 3898.42s]  did that speak about dose?
[3898.42s -> 3900.42s]  I have not read the newest one
[3900.42s -> 3901.42s]  and the previous ones,
[3901.42s -> 3904.42s]  they've simply looked at the 3 to 5 grams as well
[3904.42s -> 3905.42s]  because most times,
[3905.42s -> 3909.42s]  the only one studies that typically do the relative dose
[3909.42s -> 3911.42s]  are in my lab or in Phil Chilbeck's lab
[3911.42s -> 3913.42s]  and we're typically looking at older individuals
[3913.42s -> 3915.42s]  or athletes.
[3915.42s -> 3917.42s]  So the dose would be lower,
[3917.42s -> 3918.42s]  the 3 to 5 grams.
[3918.42s -> 3920.42s]  So if a female is listening,
[3920.42s -> 3921.42s]  say I don't, you know,
[3921.42s -> 3922.42s]  I'm going to get medical clearance,
[3922.42s -> 3924.42s]  I would strongly recommend
[3924.42s -> 3925.42s]  to start with the lowest dose,
[3925.42s -> 3927.42s]  no more than 3,
[3927.42s -> 3929.42s]  even when you get medical clearance
[3929.42s -> 3932.42s]  and then you can see how you respond over time.
[3932.42s -> 3935.42s]  Okay, let's finish with a few more
[3935.42s -> 3937.42s]  of the practical questions
[3937.42s -> 3939.42s]  that people probably have.
[3939.42s -> 3941.42s]  So you mentioned your personal strategy
[3941.42s -> 3943.42s]  is about 10 grams a day.
[3943.42s -> 3944.42s]  I'm assuming,
[3944.42s -> 3946.42s]  based off reading your studies
[3946.42s -> 3949.42s]  and also my conversation with Eric Rawlson,
[3949.42s -> 3952.42s]  that there's no need to take any form of creatine
[3952.42s -> 3954.42s]  other than creatine monohydrate.
[3954.42s -> 3955.42s]  That's correct.
[3955.42s -> 3956.42s]  So every study,
[3956.42s -> 3958.42s]  pretty much the safety and efficacy
[3958.42s -> 3959.42s]  is based on monohydrate
[3959.42s -> 3961.42s]  and monohydrate simply means
[3961.42s -> 3962.42s]  creatine linked to water.
[3962.42s -> 3963.42s]  When you ingest it,
[3963.42s -> 3965.42s]  it's identical to what's being synthesized
[3965.42s -> 3967.42s]  in the brain or liver
[3967.42s -> 3969.42s]  and that's probably why monohydrate
[3969.42s -> 3971.42s]  has such an exceptional safety profile.
[3971.42s -> 3974.42s]  And is creatine monohydrate,
[3974.42s -> 3977.42s]  is that kind of dime a dozen?
[3977.42s -> 3979.42s]  I know that a lot of brands now
[3979.42s -> 3982.42s]  are using the branded form CreaPure,
[3982.42s -> 3984.42s]  which I've seen is also being used in studies
[3984.42s -> 3986.42s]  and I think some of your studies.
[3986.42s -> 3988.42s]  Is there any reason
[3988.42s -> 3989.42s]  to kind of believe
[3989.42s -> 3991.42s]  that that might be high quality
[3991.42s -> 3993.42s]  or different to other brands
[3993.42s -> 3995.42s]  that are selling creatine monohydrate
[3995.42s -> 3997.42s]  that are not CreaPure?
[3997.42s -> 3998.42s]  Yeah, no.
[3998.42s -> 3999.42s]  At the end of the day,
[3999.42s -> 4001.42s]  the key is that it's monohydrate.
[4001.42s -> 4002.42s]  And then the other thing to look for
[4002.42s -> 4003.42s]  that it's been third party
[4003.42s -> 4004.42s]  or independently tested
[4004.42s -> 4007.42s]  for lack of purities or safety.
[4007.42s -> 4008.42s]  So make sure the individual
[4008.42s -> 4009.42s]  is looking for a product
[4009.42s -> 4011.42s]  that has third party tested,
[4011.42s -> 4012.42s]  that's independent.
[4012.42s -> 4014.42s]  So when you're buying the product
[4014.42s -> 4015.42s]  or whichever it is creatine
[4015.42s -> 4017.42s]  and then of course it's monohydrate.
[4017.42s -> 4018.42s]  At the end of it,
[4018.42s -> 4019.42s]  any monohydrate,
[4019.42s -> 4020.42s]  if it's pure,
[4020.42s -> 4021.42s]  it's going to have the same effect.
[4021.42s -> 4022.42s]  And do you have a preference
[4022.42s -> 4024.42s]  for whether that is within a blend
[4024.42s -> 4027.42s]  or an isolated ingredient?
[4027.42s -> 4028.42s]  Yeah.
[4028.42s -> 4030.42s]  So I've seen people dry scoop.
[4030.42s -> 4031.42s]  I'm like, well, creatine loves water.
[4031.42s -> 4033.42s]  So put it in solution.
[4033.42s -> 4035.42s]  I put five grams in my breakfast
[4035.42s -> 4036.42s]  in the morning.
[4036.42s -> 4037.42s]  I usually have Greek yogurt
[4037.42s -> 4039.42s]  with protein and collagen
[4039.42s -> 4040.42s]  and some berries.
[4040.42s -> 4041.42s]  And then I actually drink.
[4041.42s -> 4043.42s]  I put five grams in a water bottle
[4043.42s -> 4045.42s]  and I drink that during my workout.
[4045.42s -> 4046.42s]  I find it very easy and convenient.
[4046.42s -> 4049.42s]  So the bioavailability
[4049.42s -> 4051.42s]  will be the same dry scoop
[4051.42s -> 4053.42s]  in food or in solution.
[4053.42s -> 4054.42s]  It's really up to the person
[4054.42s -> 4056.42s]  to maintain consistency.
[4056.42s -> 4058.42s]  Speaking about how you're consuming it
[4058.42s -> 4062.42s]  or what you're consuming it with,
[4062.42s -> 4065.42s]  there's been talk,
[4065.42s -> 4066.42s]  I guess, for a long time
[4066.42s -> 4069.42s]  that consuming your creatine
[4069.42s -> 4072.42s]  with carbohydrates
[4072.42s -> 4073.42s]  can be a helpful way
[4073.42s -> 4075.42s]  for kind of driving that creatine
[4075.42s -> 4078.42s]  into muscle cells.
[4078.42s -> 4081.42s]  Is that because insulin helps
[4081.42s -> 4084.42s]  with getting creatine into muscle cells?
[4084.42s -> 4085.42s]  And is that also why
[4085.42s -> 4087.42s]  you have it with protein?
[4087.42s -> 4089.42s]  Yes, for two reasons.
[4089.42s -> 4090.42s]  So you're right.
[4090.42s -> 4092.42s]  Insulin can definitely augment
[4092.42s -> 4094.42s]  creatine uptake into the cell.
[4094.42s -> 4096.42s]  But the dose of insulin you need
[4096.42s -> 4097.42s]  is super physiological.
[4097.42s -> 4099.42s]  It's very, very high.
[4099.42s -> 4100.42s]  The lucky thing
[4100.42s -> 4101.42s]  and the nice thing is
[4101.42s -> 4102.42s]  from a population
[4102.42s -> 4103.42s]  or health perspective,
[4103.42s -> 4104.42s]  protein,
[4104.42s -> 4106.42s]  i.e. whey protein,
[4106.42s -> 4107.42s]  is very gluconeogenic
[4107.42s -> 4108.42s]  or insulin-genic.
[4108.42s -> 4109.42s]  And that can actually have
[4109.42s -> 4110.42s]  the same effect.
[4110.42s -> 4112.42s]  Mark Tonopolsky compared a study
[4112.42s -> 4114.42s]  showing it had the same effect.
[4114.42s -> 4116.42s]  And the nice thing with protein,
[4116.42s -> 4118.42s]  you get all the essential amino acids.
[4118.42s -> 4120.42s]  So I prefer protein.
[4120.42s -> 4122.42s]  I take in a bit of carbohydrates
[4122.42s -> 4124.42s]  for glycogen resynthesis as well.
[4124.42s -> 4126.42s]  But one of the best ways
[4126.42s -> 4128.42s]  to increase creatine uptake
[4128.42s -> 4129.42s]  is exercise.
[4129.42s -> 4131.42s]  Muscle contractions will stimulate
[4131.42s -> 4132.42s]  the doorways in your muscle
[4132.42s -> 4133.42s]  to allow creatine in.
[4133.42s -> 4135.42s]  So that's why one of the theories
[4135.42s -> 4136.42s]  is to consume creatine
[4136.42s -> 4139.42s]  in close proximity to exercise,
[4139.42s -> 4141.42s]  either before, during or after.
[4141.42s -> 4142.42s]  It's when blood flow
[4142.42s -> 4143.42s]  to your muscles is there.
[4143.42s -> 4145.42s]  The transport kinetics is there.
[4145.42s -> 4147.42s]  And we're looking at that
[4147.42s -> 4148.42s]  in the winter term
[4148.42s -> 4150.42s]  to see does the timing really matter
[4150.42s -> 4151.42s]  in those three areas.
[4151.42s -> 4153.42s]  But that's a really interesting,
[4153.42s -> 4154.42s]  viable way that I think
[4154.42s -> 4157.42s]  can provide at least consistency.
[4157.42s -> 4158.42s]  But there's some mechanisms
[4158.42s -> 4159.42s]  to suggest it might be
[4159.42s -> 4161.42s]  a viable way to consume it.
[4161.42s -> 4162.42s]  I think you mentioned
[4162.42s -> 4165.42s]  that you split your dose across the day.
[4165.42s -> 4167.42s]  So what are the, if any,
[4167.42s -> 4170.42s]  the advantages of splitting the dose
[4170.42s -> 4172.42s]  versus just having 10 grams
[4172.42s -> 4174.42s]  in one single bolus?
[4174.42s -> 4176.42s]  So the theory is that smaller,
[4176.42s -> 4178.42s]  more frequent dosages may lead
[4178.42s -> 4180.42s]  to an increase in absorption
[4180.42s -> 4181.42s]  and retention.
[4181.42s -> 4182.42s]  It's very similar to the theory
[4182.42s -> 4183.42s]  with protein.
[4183.42s -> 4185.42s]  Can you take 200 grams of protein
[4185.42s -> 4186.42s]  in one meal?
[4186.42s -> 4187.42s]  You can, but you're not going
[4187.42s -> 4188.42s]  to use all that from a muscle
[4188.42s -> 4189.42s]  protein perspective.
[4189.42s -> 4191.42s]  So the theory here is that
[4191.42s -> 4192.42s]  if you take smaller dosages,
[4192.42s -> 4194.42s]  maybe you're going to absorb
[4194.42s -> 4196.42s]  all of it and retain it.
[4196.42s -> 4198.42s]  Less will be degraded to creatinine.
[4198.42s -> 4200.42s]  So I take two five-gram dosages.
[4200.42s -> 4202.42s]  We actually have a study plan
[4202.42s -> 4203.42s]  where we're going to do
[4203.42s -> 4204.42s]  five two-gram dosages.
[4204.42s -> 4206.42s]  Does that make any difference
[4206.42s -> 4208.42s]  compared to a 10-gram bolus dose
[4208.42s -> 4210.42s]  to answer that exact question?
[4210.42s -> 4211.42s]  And that's going to be coming up
[4211.42s -> 4212.42s]  in the new year.
[4212.42s -> 4215.42s]  So could repeated smaller dosages
[4215.42s -> 4216.42s]  be different than a bolus?
[4216.42s -> 4217.42s]  We don't know.
[4217.42s -> 4219.42s]  And I think it'd be cool
[4219.42s -> 4220.42s]  that there was no difference
[4220.42s -> 4221.42s]  than the consumer could say,
[4221.42s -> 4223.42s]  I can take it however I like.
[4223.42s -> 4225.42s]  I know I'm going to get the same effect.
[4225.42s -> 4228.42s]  Yeah, five two-gram doses a day
[4228.42s -> 4230.42s]  might lead to slightly different
[4230.42s -> 4232.42s]  adherence somehow, I think.
[4232.42s -> 4234.42s]  That's exactly right.
[4234.42s -> 4235.42s]  What if you forget
[4235.42s -> 4236.42s]  and things like that?
[4236.42s -> 4237.42s]  So I think in today's society,
[4237.42s -> 4240.42s]  we're just trying to make things easy
[4240.42s -> 4242.42s]  and try to take away the pressures.
[4242.42s -> 4243.42s]  And that's why I'm glad
[4243.42s -> 4244.42s]  that the timing of creatine,
[4244.42s -> 4246.42s]  just like the timing of protein,
[4246.42s -> 4247.42s]  may be irrelevant.
[4247.42s -> 4248.42s]  You can just sort of eat
[4248.42s -> 4249.42s]  and enjoy life
[4249.42s -> 4251.42s]  and go on with your day.
[4251.42s -> 4254.42s]  If someone's going to start
[4254.42s -> 4256.42s]  creatine supplementation,
[4256.42s -> 4257.42s]  they either have never had it
[4257.42s -> 4260.42s]  or they're starting for the first time
[4260.42s -> 4261.42s]  in a long time,
[4261.42s -> 4264.42s]  so we can assume that their cells
[4264.42s -> 4266.42s]  are rather depleted.
[4266.42s -> 4267.42s]  Right.
[4267.42s -> 4268.42s]  Is there an advantage
[4268.42s -> 4270.42s]  to doing a sort of
[4270.42s -> 4272.42s]  quote-unquote loading phase,
[4272.42s -> 4274.42s]  a higher dose sort of period
[4274.42s -> 4275.42s]  for a week or so,
[4275.42s -> 4276.42s]  and then shifting
[4276.42s -> 4277.42s]  to that maintenance phase
[4277.42s -> 4278.42s]  versus just going straight
[4278.42s -> 4281.42s]  into a three or five grams a day dose?
[4281.42s -> 4283.42s]  Yeah, the only advantage
[4283.42s -> 4285.42s]  of the rapid loading phase
[4285.42s -> 4286.42s]  is that it will obviously
[4286.42s -> 4288.42s]  rapidly saturate the muscle
[4288.42s -> 4289.42s]  and you may get
[4289.42s -> 4292.42s]  a slightly quicker response.
[4292.42s -> 4294.42s]  The downfall is that's the time
[4294.42s -> 4298.42s]  we see some antidotal GI tract irritation,
[4298.42s -> 4301.42s]  acute water and or weight retention.
[4301.42s -> 4304.42s]  But again, the lucky thing is
[4304.42s -> 4305.42s]  three grams a day
[4305.42s -> 4306.42s]  will saturate the muscle
[4306.42s -> 4307.42s]  just the same way
[4307.42s -> 4309.42s]  it'll just take a month.
[4309.42s -> 4310.42s]  So it really depends
[4310.42s -> 4311.42s]  for the athletes,
[4311.42s -> 4313.42s]  the World Championships coming up.
[4313.42s -> 4314.42s]  If you really need
[4314.42s -> 4316.42s]  a fast rapid boost,
[4316.42s -> 4317.42s]  the loading phase
[4317.42s -> 4319.42s]  is probably something to consider.
[4319.42s -> 4320.42s]  But for everybody else listening
[4320.42s -> 4321.42s]  that says, hey,
[4321.42s -> 4322.42s]  I kind of am interested
[4322.42s -> 4324.42s]  in creatine for the lifelong journey,
[4324.42s -> 4325.42s]  three grams a day
[4325.42s -> 4327.42s]  from a muscle perspective
[4327.42s -> 4328.42s]  will saturate your muscles
[4328.42s -> 4330.42s]  and you can take that every day.
[4330.42s -> 4331.42s]  And of course, we've talked about
[4331.42s -> 4332.42s]  if you want to boost that up,
[4332.42s -> 4335.42s]  maybe some bone and or brain benefits,
[4335.42s -> 4337.42s]  that's very viable as well.
[4337.42s -> 4339.42s]  I've heard you say that
[4339.42s -> 4341.42s]  if you're worried about water retention,
[4341.42s -> 4344.42s]  dividing your dose out across the day
[4344.42s -> 4346.42s]  could be a useful strategy.
[4346.42s -> 4347.42s]  My question,
[4347.42s -> 4349.42s]  I guess that I have with this
[4349.42s -> 4350.42s]  is earlier,
[4350.42s -> 4353.42s]  I believe you kind of mentioned
[4353.42s -> 4354.42s]  that it might be
[4354.42s -> 4356.42s]  the swelling of the muscle
[4356.42s -> 4357.42s]  and the pulling of the water
[4357.42s -> 4359.42s]  into the muscle tissue
[4359.42s -> 4360.42s]  that is leading
[4360.42s -> 4362.42s]  to some of these beneficial changes
[4362.42s -> 4365.42s]  that we're seeing from a hypertrophy
[4365.42s -> 4366.42s]  or strength point of view.
[4366.42s -> 4369.42s]  So could it actually be
[4369.42s -> 4372.42s]  that spreading the dose out across the day
[4372.42s -> 4374.42s]  while it might lead to less water retention
[4374.42s -> 4375.42s]  is actually reducing
[4375.42s -> 4377.42s]  some of the ergogenic benefits
[4377.42s -> 4378.42s]  that come with creatine?
[4378.42s -> 4380.42s]  Excellent analogy.
[4380.42s -> 4382.42s]  It's something I've thought of.
[4382.42s -> 4383.42s]  It will accumulate
[4383.42s -> 4385.42s]  or have water drag every time
[4385.42s -> 4387.42s]  it's being continually taken in.
[4387.42s -> 4389.42s]  But that's an excellent question.
[4389.42s -> 4391.42s]  Could the bolus cause more of a tidal wave,
[4391.42s -> 4392.42s]  if you will,
[4392.42s -> 4394.42s]  whereas more smaller dosages
[4394.42s -> 4396.42s]  cause more of a consistent change
[4396.42s -> 4397.42s]  and trickling in effect?
[4397.42s -> 4399.42s]  Does that lead to any of the differences?
[4399.42s -> 4400.42s]  We just don't know.
[4400.42s -> 4401.42s]  And that's something
[4401.42s -> 4402.42s]  that we're going to be considering
[4402.42s -> 4403.42s]  with that dosing study.
[4403.42s -> 4407.42s]  What about this idea of cycling creatine?
[4407.42s -> 4411.42s]  Do we need to come off of creatine
[4411.42s -> 4414.42s]  and give our body a rest?
[4414.42s -> 4417.42s]  Or is it something that we can just take
[4417.42s -> 4419.42s]  on an ongoing basis?
[4419.42s -> 4421.42s]  Yeah, we see no evidence in humans
[4421.42s -> 4423.42s]  that you downregulate
[4423.42s -> 4425.42s]  your natural endogenous synthesis
[4425.42s -> 4426.42s]  with chronic creatine.
[4426.42s -> 4429.42s]  We've actually given it continuously for years.
[4429.42s -> 4431.42s]  So the theory is that there's no evidence
[4431.42s -> 4433.42s]  to suggest you have to cycle it.
[4433.42s -> 4435.42s]  There's no evidence to suggest
[4435.42s -> 4436.42s]  you get greater effects
[4436.42s -> 4438.42s]  by cycling it versus continuous.
[4438.42s -> 4440.42s]  And that's a study that desperately needs to be done
[4440.42s -> 4442.42s]  and ironically has never been shown.
[4442.42s -> 4443.42s]  But in theory,
[4443.42s -> 4445.42s]  there's no reason that you need to cycle it.
[4445.42s -> 4446.42s]  But if you say,
[4446.42s -> 4448.42s]  hey, I can't afford creatine
[4448.42s -> 4449.42s]  or I'm traveling,
[4449.42s -> 4450.42s]  keep in mind,
[4450.42s -> 4451.42s]  it stays in your muscles
[4451.42s -> 4452.42s]  for at least a month.
[4452.42s -> 4454.42s]  So you could cycle it indirectly
[4454.42s -> 4455.42s]  and still experience benefits.
[4455.42s -> 4458.42s]  And you mentioned before
[4458.42s -> 4460.42s]  that having creatine
[4460.42s -> 4462.42s]  sort of right before a workout
[4462.42s -> 4464.42s]  or during a workout in your water
[4464.42s -> 4466.42s]  or after is a good strategy
[4466.42s -> 4468.42s]  for increasing the uptake
[4468.42s -> 4471.42s]  of that creatine into muscle cells.
[4471.42s -> 4473.42s]  But just to be clear,
[4473.42s -> 4475.42s]  people should be supplementing
[4475.42s -> 4478.42s]  on both training and non-training days.
[4478.42s -> 4480.42s]  Ideally, yes.
[4480.42s -> 4482.42s]  Now from a whole body perspective.
[4482.42s -> 4484.42s]  So there is some studies that have shown
[4484.42s -> 4485.42s]  you can just take creatine
[4485.42s -> 4486.42s]  on the days you work out
[4486.42s -> 4488.42s]  and get muscle benefits.
[4488.42s -> 4489.42s]  But I now think of,
[4489.42s -> 4490.42s]  well, wait a minute,
[4490.42s -> 4492.42s]  it wants to trickle into other areas.
[4492.42s -> 4494.42s]  And I think from a consistency perspective,
[4494.42s -> 4497.42s]  it may be best to take it every day.
[4497.42s -> 4498.42s]  And how quickly
[4498.42s -> 4501.42s]  would someone experience benefits
[4501.42s -> 4503.42s]  and what might they notice
[4503.42s -> 4505.42s]  in order to know that it's working
[4505.42s -> 4508.42s]  and they're actually a responder?
[4508.42s -> 4509.42s]  Yeah, it might come down
[4509.42s -> 4511.42s]  to the dosing protocol.
[4511.42s -> 4512.42s]  I think the loading phase,
[4512.42s -> 4513.42s]  you could experience results
[4513.42s -> 4515.42s]  maybe in as little as a few weeks,
[4515.42s -> 4516.42s]  probably from a strength
[4516.42s -> 4519.42s]  or exercise capacity perspective.
[4519.42s -> 4521.42s]  But if you start with the lowest dose,
[4521.42s -> 4523.42s]  it'll probably take you more time,
[4523.42s -> 4525.42s]  say maybe a month to notice.
[4525.42s -> 4527.42s]  I could get a few more repetitions
[4527.42s -> 4529.42s]  or my clothes is getting a bit tighter
[4529.42s -> 4531.42s]  or I can run faster, recover.
[4531.42s -> 4532.42s]  So it probably comes down
[4532.42s -> 4533.42s]  to the dosing paradigm
[4533.42s -> 4535.42s]  or protocol you're doing.
[4535.42s -> 4537.42s]  And are there actually,
[4537.42s -> 4538.42s]  I guess, quote unquote,
[4538.42s -> 4541.42s]  true non-responders,
[4541.42s -> 4543.42s]  a percentage of the population,
[4543.42s -> 4544.42s]  that literally would be
[4544.42s -> 4545.42s]  wasting their money
[4545.42s -> 4547.42s]  if they were taking creatine?
[4547.42s -> 4548.42s]  Yeah, we know it
[4548.42s -> 4549.42s]  from a muscle perspective.
[4549.42s -> 4551.42s]  Yeah, if you have a high amount
[4551.42s -> 4552.42s]  already in the muscle.
[4552.42s -> 4554.42s]  So on average,
[4554.42s -> 4555.42s]  the average human can store
[4555.42s -> 4557.42s]  about 160 millimoles
[4557.42s -> 4560.42s]  or just think 160 grams of creatine.
[4560.42s -> 4561.42s]  Well, we can only store
[4561.42s -> 4562.42s]  a small amount.
[4562.42s -> 4565.42s]  We start out about 80 to 120.
[4565.42s -> 4566.42s]  So there are some people
[4566.42s -> 4568.42s]  who can be already at the ceiling.
[4568.42s -> 4569.42s]  And I would guess
[4569.42s -> 4571.42s]  if you're on a carnivore diet,
[4571.42s -> 4573.42s]  you're probably at the ceiling
[4573.42s -> 4574.42s]  when it comes to muscle
[4574.42s -> 4576.42s]  and potentially bone and brain.
[4576.42s -> 4578.42s]  If you're eating three steaks a day
[4578.42s -> 4579.42s]  and two salmons,
[4579.42s -> 4580.42s]  you're probably getting
[4580.42s -> 4581.42s]  an adequate amount.
[4581.42s -> 4582.42s]  So it might come down
[4582.42s -> 4584.42s]  to your habitual diet.
[4584.42s -> 4585.42s]  Right.
[4585.42s -> 4587.42s]  So if you're on a carnivore diet,
[4587.42s -> 4588.42s]  you probably don't need
[4588.42s -> 4589.42s]  to be thinking about creatine,
[4589.42s -> 4591.42s]  but perhaps glycogen.
[4591.42s -> 4593.42s]  I want to think about glycogen stores.
[4593.42s -> 4594.42s]  Yes, and fiber.
[4594.42s -> 4596.42s]  That's right.
[4596.42s -> 4598.42s]  This is more of a study design
[4598.42s -> 4599.42s]  question for you.
[4599.42s -> 4602.42s]  And it's actually,
[4602.42s -> 4603.42s]  you know,
[4603.42s -> 4605.42s]  in your wheelhouse.
[4605.42s -> 4606.42s]  Okay.
[4606.42s -> 4608.42s]  What do you think about studies
[4608.42s -> 4611.42s]  comparing muscle protein synthesis,
[4611.42s -> 4613.42s]  muscle mass and strength
[4613.42s -> 4614.42s]  between omnivorous diets
[4614.42s -> 4615.42s]  and plant-based diets?
[4615.42s -> 4617.42s]  And one of Hamilton and Rochelle's study
[4617.42s -> 4618.42s]  comes to mind here.
[4618.42s -> 4619.42s]  There's a few
[4619.42s -> 4623.42s]  that don't match creatine intake.
[4623.42s -> 4625.42s]  Given the differences
[4625.42s -> 4627.42s]  in creatine levels
[4627.42s -> 4629.42s]  in muscle tissue at baseline
[4629.42s -> 4630.42s]  that would exist
[4630.42s -> 4632.42s]  between protein
[4632.42s -> 4633.42s]  and plant-based diet,
[4633.42s -> 4634.42s]  what would you say
[4634.42s -> 4635.42s]  about people adopting
[4635.42s -> 4636.42s]  an omnivorous diet
[4636.42s -> 4637.42s]  and those adopting
[4637.42s -> 4638.42s]  a vegan or a plant-based diet?
[4638.42s -> 4639.42s]  That's an outstanding idea.
[4639.42s -> 4640.42s]  I've thought about this as well
[4640.42s -> 4641.42s]  because the theory
[4641.42s -> 4642.42s]  with plant-based diets
[4642.42s -> 4643.42s]  on protein,
[4643.42s -> 4644.42s]  you just need to eat more.
[4644.42s -> 4645.42s]  And then the question is,
[4645.42s -> 4646.42s]  and that was brought up,
[4646.42s -> 4647.42s]  well,
[4647.42s -> 4648.42s]  if they're eating more protein,
[4648.42s -> 4649.42s]  are they getting it
[4649.42s -> 4650.42s]  from animal sources?
[4650.42s -> 4651.42s]  And maybe that group
[4651.42s -> 4652.42s]  had a lot more.
[4652.42s -> 4653.42s]  And so you would have
[4653.42s -> 4654.42s]  to match creatine
[4654.42s -> 4655.42s]  or give creatine
[4655.42s -> 4656.42s]  to the vegan
[4656.42s -> 4657.42s]  or plant-based group
[4657.42s -> 4658.42s]  and then you would have
[4658.42s -> 4659.42s]  to give creatine
[4659.42s -> 4660.42s]  to the vegan
[4660.42s -> 4661.42s]  or plant-based group
[4661.42s -> 4663.42s]  and maybe that would offset
[4663.42s -> 4664.42s]  because a lot of the arguments
[4664.42s -> 4665.42s]  against protein
[4665.42s -> 4666.42s]  is maybe one group
[4666.42s -> 4667.42s]  was getting a supplement
[4667.42s -> 4668.42s]  and they were eating more
[4668.42s -> 4669.42s]  and if they're getting
[4669.42s -> 4670.42s]  over 1.6 grams,
[4670.42s -> 4671.42s]  that could be adequate.
[4671.42s -> 4673.42s]  But that's an excellent point
[4673.42s -> 4674.42s]  and that's something
[4674.42s -> 4675.42s]  that can be looked at.
[4675.42s -> 4676.42s]  The difficulty
[4676.42s -> 4679.42s]  is trying to adequately determine
[4679.42s -> 4680.42s]  how much creatine
[4680.42s -> 4681.42s]  you're naturally producing.
[4681.42s -> 4683.42s]  You need to do biopsies
[4683.42s -> 4685.42s]  and or measure it in the blood
[4685.42s -> 4686.42s]  and you need to know
[4686.42s -> 4687.42s]  how much you're eating.
[4687.42s -> 4688.42s]  And a lot of our technology
[4688.42s -> 4689.42s]  from food records
[4689.42s -> 4691.42s]  to frequency questionnaires
[4691.42s -> 4692.42s]  is really limited
[4692.42s -> 4693.42s]  on how much creatine
[4693.42s -> 4695.42s]  is naturally in your food.
[4695.42s -> 4697.42s]  And then that piggybacks on
[4697.42s -> 4699.42s]  when you're heating the meat,
[4699.42s -> 4700.42s]  does that denature
[4700.42s -> 4701.42s]  some of the creatine
[4701.42s -> 4702.42s]  and we think it does as well.
[4702.42s -> 4703.42s]  So there's a lot of issues
[4703.42s -> 4704.42s]  with that.
[4704.42s -> 4705.42s]  Yeah.
[4705.42s -> 4706.42s]  But it's really
[4706.42s -> 4707.42s]  an important point.
[4707.42s -> 4708.42s]  Yeah.
[4708.42s -> 4709.42s]  Maybe one way
[4709.42s -> 4710.42s]  of getting around this
[4710.42s -> 4711.42s]  and I'm just thinking out loud
[4711.42s -> 4712.42s]  is just to have both groups
[4712.42s -> 4714.42s]  having five grams a day.
[4714.42s -> 4715.42s]  Yes.
[4715.42s -> 4716.42s]  Or some sort of dose
[4716.42s -> 4717.42s]  that you would know
[4717.42s -> 4718.42s]  would fully saturate
[4718.42s -> 4720.42s]  the muscle cells
[4720.42s -> 4721.42s]  in both scenarios.
[4721.42s -> 4722.42s]  So then the only difference
[4722.42s -> 4724.42s]  is the source of protein.
[4724.42s -> 4725.42s]  Right.
[4725.42s -> 4726.42s]  And you would do
[4726.42s -> 4727.42s]  the exact same thing.
[4727.42s -> 4728.42s]  We would probably do
[4728.42s -> 4729.42s]  muscle biopsies
[4729.42s -> 4730.42s]  and then hopefully
[4730.42s -> 4731.42s]  if the vegan group
[4731.42s -> 4732.42s]  was at just say 80
[4732.42s -> 4733.42s]  and the omnivore group
[4733.42s -> 4734.42s]  was already at 120,
[4734.42s -> 4735.42s]  you would just difference
[4735.42s -> 4736.42s]  over time
[4736.42s -> 4737.42s]  they would eventually
[4737.42s -> 4738.42s]  get to 160
[4738.42s -> 4739.42s]  and then any excess
[4739.42s -> 4740.42s]  would be excreted
[4740.42s -> 4741.42s]  because now
[4741.42s -> 4742.42s]  we're just focusing
[4742.42s -> 4743.42s]  on the muscle perspective.
[4743.42s -> 4744.42s]  Yeah.
[4744.42s -> 4745.42s]  That's an excellent way
[4745.42s -> 4746.42s]  to look at it.
[4746.42s -> 4747.42s]  Super interesting.
[4747.42s -> 4748.42s]  Yeah.
[4748.42s -> 4749.42s]  We spoke about water retention
[4749.42s -> 4750.42s]  and I think
[4750.42s -> 4751.42s]  a lot of people,
[4751.42s -> 4752.42s]  I certainly get
[4752.42s -> 4753.42s]  a lot of questions
[4753.42s -> 4754.42s]  and they seem
[4754.42s -> 4755.42s]  to come mostly
[4755.42s -> 4756.42s]  from women
[4756.42s -> 4757.42s]  who are concerned
[4757.42s -> 4758.42s]  with creatine
[4758.42s -> 4759.42s]  and gaining weight
[4759.42s -> 4760.42s]  and seeing the number
[4760.42s -> 4761.42s]  on the scales
[4761.42s -> 4762.42s]  go up
[4762.42s -> 4763.42s]  and we've spoken
[4763.42s -> 4764.42s]  about water retention.
[4764.42s -> 4765.42s]  Does creatine
[4765.42s -> 4766.42s]  affect body fat levels?
[4766.42s -> 4767.42s]  It's an excellent
[4767.42s -> 4768.42s]  and good timing
[4768.42s -> 4769.42s]  of the question.
[4769.42s -> 4770.42s]  We sort of published
[4770.42s -> 4771.42s]  two reviews
[4771.42s -> 4772.42s]  in the last two years
[4772.42s -> 4773.42s]  looking at
[4773.42s -> 4774.42s]  all the data
[4774.42s -> 4775.42s]  looking at measures
[4775.42s -> 4776.42s]  of fat mass.
[4776.42s -> 4777.42s]  And I think
[4777.42s -> 4778.42s]  there's a lot
[4778.42s -> 4779.42s]  of people
[4779.42s -> 4780.42s]  who are concerned
[4780.42s -> 4781.42s]  about the fact
[4781.42s -> 4782.42s]  that creatine
[4782.42s -> 4783.42s]  has been shown
[4783.42s -> 4784.42s]  to decrease
[4784.42s -> 4785.42s]  body fat percentage.
[4785.42s -> 4786.42s]  So let me repeat
[4786.42s -> 4787.42s]  that it's been shown
[4787.42s -> 4788.42s]  to decrease
[4788.42s -> 4789.42s]  body fat percentage
[4789.42s -> 4790.42s]  but by a measly
[4790.42s -> 4791.42s]  1%.
[4791.42s -> 4792.42s]  It doesn't have
[4792.42s -> 4793.42s]  any decrease
[4793.42s -> 4794.42s]  in absolute
[4794.42s -> 4795.42s]  fat mass.
[4795.42s -> 4796.42s]  So all
[4796.42s -> 4797.42s]  we can conclude
[4797.42s -> 4798.42s]  is if the number
[4798.42s -> 4799.42s]  is going up
[4799.42s -> 4800.42s]  on the scale
[4800.42s -> 4801.42s]  it's likely
[4801.42s -> 4802.42s]  a net water
[4802.42s -> 4803.42s]  or a net retention
[4803.42s -> 4804.42s]  of body water.
[4804.42s -> 4805.42s]  But if it's going
[4805.42s -> 4806.42s]  up on the scale
[4806.42s -> 4807.42s]  over time
[4807.42s -> 4808.42s]  which actually
[4808.42s -> 4809.42s]  it doesn't actually
[4809.42s -> 4810.42s]  mean that much
[4810.42s -> 4811.42s]  it's probably
[4811.42s -> 4812.42s]  and likely
[4812.42s -> 4813.42s]  some type
[4813.42s -> 4814.42s]  of lean tissue
[4814.42s -> 4815.42s]  mass measure.
[4815.42s -> 4816.42s]  Organ which usually
[4816.42s -> 4817.42s]  doesn't occur
[4817.42s -> 4818.42s]  maybe it's hydration
[4818.42s -> 4819.42s]  and or lean tissue.
[4819.42s -> 4820.42s]  But we're pretty
[4820.42s -> 4821.42s]  confident
[4821.42s -> 4822.42s]  looking at all
[4822.42s -> 4823.42s]  the data
[4823.42s -> 4824.42s]  your body fat
[4824.42s -> 4825.42s]  won't go up
[4825.42s -> 4826.42s]  and that's
[4826.42s -> 4827.42s]  something
[4827.42s -> 4828.42s]  that's encouraging
[4828.42s -> 4829.42s]  hopefully
[4829.42s -> 4830.42s]  from a population
[4830.42s -> 4831.42s]  perspective.
[4831.42s -> 4832.42s]  And then a question
[4832.42s -> 4833.42s]  that mostly
[4833.42s -> 4834.42s]  comes from
[4834.42s -> 4835.42s]  men
[4835.42s -> 4836.42s]  but not exclusively
[4836.42s -> 4837.42s]  is whether
[4837.42s -> 4838.42s]  or not creatine
[4838.42s -> 4839.42s]  can increase
[4839.42s -> 4840.42s]  creatine
[4840.42s -> 4841.42s]  or DHT
[4841.42s -> 4842.42s]  and therefore
[4842.42s -> 4843.42s]  potentially promote
[4843.42s -> 4844.42s]  hair loss.
[4844.42s -> 4845.42s]  I get this
[4845.42s -> 4846.42s]  question literally
[4846.42s -> 4847.42s]  every day.
[4847.42s -> 4848.42s]  So I've sort
[4848.42s -> 4849.42s]  of changed
[4849.42s -> 4850.42s]  my view
[4850.42s -> 4851.42s]  on how I
[4851.42s -> 4852.42s]  answer this.
[4852.42s -> 4853.42s]  So the world
[4853.42s -> 4854.42s]  famous rugby
[4854.42s -> 4855.42s]  study that was
[4855.42s -> 4856.42s]  done over
[4856.42s -> 4857.42s]  a decade
[4857.42s -> 4858.42s]  ago young
[4858.42s -> 4859.42s]  individuals
[4859.42s -> 4860.42s]  resistance
[4860.42s -> 4861.42s]  training
[4861.42s -> 4862.42s]  training for
[4862.42s -> 4863.42s]  rugby
[4863.42s -> 4864.42s]  were taking
[4864.42s -> 4865.42s]  20 grams
[4865.42s -> 4866.42s]  a day of
[4866.42s -> 4867.42s]  creatine
[4867.42s -> 4868.42s]  and measured
[4868.42s -> 4869.42s]  their cholesterol
[4869.42s -> 4870.42s]  blood glucose
[4870.42s -> 4871.42s]  their DHT levels
[4871.42s -> 4872.42s]  did go up
[4872.42s -> 4873.42s]  and then when you
[4873.42s -> 4874.42s]  look at the study
[4874.42s -> 4875.42s]  it was serum DHT
[4875.42s -> 4876.42s]  and then when you
[4876.42s -> 4877.42s]  go to biology
[4877.42s -> 4878.42s]  and genetics
[4878.42s -> 4879.42s]  textbooks
[4879.42s -> 4880.42s]  serum DHT
[4880.42s -> 4881.42s]  doesn't really
[4881.42s -> 4882.42s]  correlate with
[4882.42s -> 4883.42s]  follicle loss
[4883.42s -> 4884.42s]  or hair thinning.
[4884.42s -> 4885.42s]  So when someone
[4885.42s -> 4886.42s]  says does creatine
[4886.42s -> 4887.42s]  cause baldness
[4887.42s -> 4888.42s]  I say we have
[4888.42s -> 4889.42s]  no idea.
[4889.42s -> 4890.42s]  No study has ever
[4890.42s -> 4891.42s]  shown hair follicle
[4891.42s -> 4892.42s]  loss
[4892.42s -> 4893.42s]  or thinning.
[4893.42s -> 4894.42s]  That single study
[4894.42s -> 4895.42s]  that has been shown
[4895.42s -> 4896.42s]  to be correlated
[4896.42s -> 4897.42s]  with DHT
[4897.42s -> 4898.42s]  shows as the
[4898.42s -> 4899.42s]  hormone went up.
[4899.42s -> 4900.42s]  So the people
[4900.42s -> 4901.42s]  ask every day
[4901.42s -> 4902.42s]  does creatine
[4902.42s -> 4903.42s]  cause baldness.
[4903.42s -> 4904.42s]  I'm a bad
[4904.42s -> 4905.42s]  messenger obviously
[4905.42s -> 4906.42s]  if people can see
[4906.42s -> 4907.42s]  me but I will
[4907.42s -> 4908.42s]  say that I've
[4908.42s -> 4909.42s]  studied over a
[4909.42s -> 4910.42s]  thousand people
[4910.42s -> 4911.42s]  in the lab and
[4911.42s -> 4912.42s]  not a single
[4912.42s -> 4913.42s]  person has come
[4913.42s -> 4914.42s]  to me and said
[4914.42s -> 4915.42s]  that their hair
[4915.42s -> 4916.42s]  was thinning.
[4916.42s -> 4917.42s]  So I'm not sure
[4917.42s -> 4918.42s]  why the study
[4918.42s -> 4919.42s]  has never been
[4919.42s -> 4920.42s]  done.
[4920.42s -> 4921.42s]  You would simply
[4921.42s -> 4922.42s]  need to look at
[4922.42s -> 4923.42s]  a cross section
[4923.42s -> 4924.42s]  of the head
[4924.42s -> 4925.42s]  and then measure
[4925.42s -> 4926.42s]  cross sectional
[4926.42s -> 4927.42s]  area and or hair
[4927.42s -> 4928.42s]  loss.
[4928.42s -> 4929.42s]  But again,
[4929.42s -> 4930.42s]  the theory
[4930.42s -> 4931.42s]  has not been
[4931.42s -> 4932.42s]  replicated.
[4932.42s -> 4933.42s]  We're not seeing
[4933.42s -> 4934.42s]  any differences
[4934.42s -> 4935.42s]  in free testosterone,
[4935.42s -> 4936.42s]  DHT,
[4936.42s -> 4937.42s]  or any other
[4937.42s -> 4938.42s]  hormonal influence
[4938.42s -> 4939.42s]  with that.
[4939.42s -> 4940.42s]  But when I look
[4940.42s -> 4941.42s]  in the mirror
[4941.42s -> 4942.42s]  I'm wondering
[4942.42s -> 4943.42s]  God,
[4943.42s -> 4944.42s]  I think I was
[4944.42s -> 4945.42s]  going bald
[4945.42s -> 4946.42s]  before I started
[4946.42s -> 4947.42s]  creatine so hopefully
[4947.42s -> 4948.42s]  it never accelerated
[4948.42s -> 4949.42s]  it.
[4949.42s -> 4950.42s]  Yeah.
[4950.42s -> 4951.42s]  Okay.
[4951.42s -> 4952.42s]  Well that's
[4952.42s -> 4953.42s]  going to be
[4953.42s -> 4954.42s]  comforting to a
[4954.42s -> 4955.42s]  lot of people.
[4955.42s -> 4956.42s]  Cause there's
[4956.42s -> 4957.42s]  many people who take creatine
[4957.42s -> 4958.42s]  supplements.
[4958.42s -> 4959.42s]  Right.
[4959.42s -> 4960.42s]  Is it true
[4960.42s -> 4961.42s]  that creatine
[4961.42s -> 4962.42s]  supplementation
[4962.42s -> 4963.42s]  could have a
[4963.42s -> 4964.42s]  negative effect
[4964.42s -> 4965.42s]  on liver
[4965.42s -> 4966.42s]  and kidney
[4966.42s -> 4967.42s]  function?
[4967.42s -> 4968.42s]  Yeah,
[4968.42s -> 4969.42s]  this is probably
[4969.42s -> 4970.42s]  the most studied
[4970.42s -> 4971.42s]  area and I'm
[4971.42s -> 4972.42s]  very happy
[4972.42s -> 4973.42s]  to say that
[4973.42s -> 4974.42s]  when you look
[4974.42s -> 4975.42s]  at all the
[4975.42s -> 4976.42s]  randomized
[4976.42s -> 4977.42s]  clinical trials
[4977.42s -> 4978.42s]  compared to
[4978.42s -> 4979.42s]  placebo we're
[4979.42s -> 4980.42s]  not seeing
[4980.42s -> 4981.42s]  any adverse
[4981.42s -> 4982.42s]  effect not only
[4982.42s -> 4983.42s]  on renal
[4983.42s -> 4984.42s]  but cardiovascular
[4984.42s -> 4985.42s]  or blood cell
[4985.42s -> 4986.42s]  count.
[4986.42s -> 4987.42s]  We also consider
[4987.42s -> 4988.42s]  a population
[4988.42s -> 4989.42s]  that is probably
[4989.42s -> 4990.42s]  has a little bit
[4990.42s -> 4991.42s]  of organ
[4991.42s -> 4992.42s]  deterioration
[4992.42s -> 4993.42s]  as we get older.
[4993.42s -> 4994.42s]  11 grams
[4994.42s -> 4995.42s]  of creatine
[4995.42s -> 4996.42s]  for two straight
[4996.42s -> 4997.42s]  days had no
[4997.42s -> 4998.42s]  adverse effect
[4998.42s -> 4999.42s]  on measures
[4999.42s -> 5000.42s]  of kidney
[5000.42s -> 5001.42s]  or liver
[5001.42s -> 5002.42s]  function.
[5002.42s -> 5003.42s]  And when you
[5003.42s -> 5004.42s]  combine that
[5004.42s -> 5005.42s]  with all the
[5005.42s -> 5006.42s]  other clinical
[5006.42s -> 5007.42s]  studies we
[5007.42s -> 5008.42s]  don't see
[5008.42s -> 5009.42s]  any adverse
[5009.42s -> 5010.42s]  effects even
[5010.42s -> 5011.42s]  now at higher
[5011.42s -> 5012.42s]  dosages.
[5012.42s -> 5013.42s]  But I think
[5013.42s -> 5014.42s]  it's one of
[5014.42s -> 5015.42s]  the safe
[5015.42s -> 5016.42s]  things to
[5016.42s -> 5017.42s]  take into
[5017.42s -> 5018.42s]  account
[5018.42s -> 5019.42s]  for kidney
[5019.42s -> 5020.42s]  disease or
[5020.42s -> 5021.42s]  is there
[5021.42s -> 5022.42s]  anyone that
[5022.42s -> 5023.42s]  shouldn't take
[5023.42s -> 5024.42s]  creatine?
[5024.42s -> 5025.42s]  Yeah,
[5025.42s -> 5026.42s]  so in mice
[5026.42s -> 5027.42s]  it's been shown
[5027.42s -> 5028.42s]  to have if
[5028.42s -> 5029.42s]  the individuals
[5029.42s -> 5030.42s]  have pre-existing
[5030.42s -> 5031.42s]  kidney or liver
[5031.42s -> 5032.42s]  abnormalities
[5032.42s -> 5033.42s]  to get medical
[5033.42s -> 5034.42s]  clearance and
[5034.42s -> 5035.42s]  maybe creatine
[5035.42s -> 5036.42s]  at higher
[5036.42s -> 5037.42s]  dosages may
[5037.42s -> 5038.42s]  not be advised.
[5038.42s -> 5039.42s]  So for anybody
[5039.42s -> 5040.42s]  listening if you
[5040.42s -> 5041.42s]  have a family
[5041.42s -> 5042.42s]  history of
[5042.42s -> 5043.42s]  renal or liver
[5043.42s -> 5044.42s]  hepatic issues
[5044.42s -> 5045.42s]  or any other
[5045.42s -> 5046.42s]  issues in
[5046.42s -> 5047.42s]  the body
[5047.42s -> 5048.42s]  then you
[5048.42s -> 5049.42s]  should
[5049.42s -> 5050.42s]  definitely
[5050.42s -> 5051.42s]  take creatine.
[5051.42s -> 5052.42s]  Are there any
[5052.42s -> 5053.42s]  blood tests
[5053.42s -> 5054.42s]  to keep an eye
[5054.42s -> 5055.42s]  on that are
[5055.42s -> 5056.42s]  I guess a bit
[5056.42s -> 5057.42s]  of a window
[5057.42s -> 5058.42s]  into your
[5058.42s -> 5059.42s]  biology and
[5059.42s -> 5060.42s]  whether the
[5060.42s -> 5061.42s]  liver or the
[5061.42s -> 5062.42s]  kidney are
[5062.42s -> 5063.42s]  under stress
[5063.42s -> 5064.42s]  from the
[5064.42s -> 5065.42s]  creatine that
[5065.42s -> 5066.42s]  you're taking?
[5066.42s -> 5067.42s]  Yeah, if
[5067.42s -> 5068.42s]  you're not
[5068.42s -> 5069.42s]  taking creatine
[5069.42s -> 5070.42s]  and you go
[5070.42s -> 5071.42s]  to your
[5071.42s -> 5072.42s]  doctor and
[5072.42s -> 5073.42s]  when they
[5073.42s -> 5074.42s]  measure on
[5074.42s -> 5075.42s]  that equation
[5075.42s -> 5076.42s]  that there's
[5076.42s -> 5077.42s]  something causing
[5077.42s -> 5078.42s]  an abnormality
[5078.42s -> 5079.42s]  but that also
[5079.42s -> 5080.42s]  leads to when
[5080.42s -> 5081.42s]  you take creatine
[5081.42s -> 5082.42s]  this is also
[5082.42s -> 5083.42s]  important.
[5083.42s -> 5084.42s]  So a lot of
[5084.42s -> 5085.42s]  doctors around
[5085.42s -> 5086.42s]  the world use
[5086.42s -> 5087.42s]  an estimated
[5087.42s -> 5088.42s]  filtration rate
[5088.42s -> 5089.42s]  to measure
[5089.42s -> 5090.42s]  kidney function
[5090.42s -> 5091.42s]  and remember
[5091.42s -> 5092.42s]  when creatine
[5092.42s -> 5093.42s]  is locked in
[5093.42s -> 5094.42s]  the muscle
[5094.42s -> 5095.42s]  it gets
[5095.42s -> 5096.42s]  diffused or
[5096.42s -> 5097.42s]  leaves the
[5097.42s -> 5098.42s]  muscle in the
[5098.42s -> 5099.42s]  form of
[5099.42s -> 5100.42s]  something called
[5100.42s -> 5101.42s]  creatinine
[5101.42s -> 5102.42s]  and blood
[5102.42s -> 5103.42s]  creatinine
[5103.42s -> 5104.42s]  is used to
[5104.42s -> 5105.42s]  control
[5105.42s -> 5106.42s]  creatinine
[5106.42s -> 5107.42s]  and when
[5107.42s -> 5108.42s]  you take
[5108.42s -> 5109.42s]  creatine
[5109.42s -> 5110.42s]  it's highly
[5110.42s -> 5111.42s]  likely you're
[5111.42s -> 5112.42s]  going to have
[5112.42s -> 5113.42s]  elevated
[5113.42s -> 5114.42s]  creatinine
[5114.42s -> 5115.42s]  which will
[5115.42s -> 5116.42s]  indirectly be a
[5116.42s -> 5117.42s]  false positive
[5117.42s -> 5118.42s]  for kidney
[5118.42s -> 5119.42s]  failure.
[5119.42s -> 5120.42s]  So a lot of
[5120.42s -> 5121.42s]  people when
[5121.42s -> 5122.42s]  they go to
[5122.42s -> 5123.42s]  their doctor
[5123.42s -> 5124.42s]  please make
[5124.42s -> 5125.42s]  sure you
[5125.42s -> 5126.42s]  tell your
[5126.42s -> 5127.42s]  nephrologist
[5127.42s -> 5128.42s]  or GP
[5128.42s -> 5129.42s]  that you're
[5129.42s -> 5130.42s]  on creatine
[5130.42s -> 5131.42s]  because usually
[5131.42s -> 5132.42s]  it elevates
[5132.42s -> 5133.42s]  these enzymes
[5133.42s -> 5134.42s]  and you'll
[5134.42s -> 5135.42s]  also sometimes
[5135.42s -> 5136.42s]  see a lowering
[5136.42s -> 5137.42s]  of the estimated
[5137.42s -> 5138.42s]  glomerular
[5138.42s -> 5139.42s]  filtration rate
[5139.42s -> 5140.42s]  at the same time.
[5140.42s -> 5141.42s]  It's showing that
[5141.42s -> 5142.42s]  the filtration
[5142.42s -> 5143.42s]  or the
[5143.42s -> 5144.42s]  tubules in the
[5144.42s -> 5145.42s]  kidneys are not
[5145.42s -> 5146.42s]  extracting it
[5146.42s -> 5147.42s]  from the blood
[5147.42s -> 5148.42s]  so if it's elevated
[5148.42s -> 5149.42s]  in the blood
[5149.42s -> 5150.42s]  that says the
[5150.42s -> 5151.42s]  kidneys are not
[5151.42s -> 5152.42s]  filtering into
[5152.42s -> 5153.42s]  the urine
[5153.42s -> 5154.42s]  so it's an
[5154.42s -> 5155.42s]  indication yes
[5155.42s -> 5156.42s]  absolutely.
[5156.42s -> 5157.42s]  Okay and last
[5157.42s -> 5158.42s]  one before I
[5158.42s -> 5159.42s]  let you go
[5159.42s -> 5160.42s]  and I have a
[5160.42s -> 5161.42s]  meeting with
[5161.42s -> 5162.42s]  one of your
[5162.42s -> 5163.42s]  friends here
[5163.42s -> 5164.42s]  is there any
[5164.42s -> 5165.42s]  way for people
[5165.42s -> 5166.42s]  to kind of
[5166.42s -> 5167.42s]  reduce these?
[5167.42s -> 5168.42s]  Yeah they're
[5168.42s -> 5169.42s]  very rare.
[5169.42s -> 5170.42s]  We usually
[5170.42s -> 5171.42s]  only see them
[5171.42s -> 5172.42s]  on a high
[5172.42s -> 5173.42s]  high dose
[5173.42s -> 5174.42s]  such as the
[5174.42s -> 5175.42s]  loading phase
[5175.42s -> 5176.42s]  and anecdotally
[5176.42s -> 5177.42s]  when people
[5177.42s -> 5178.42s]  combine creatine
[5178.42s -> 5179.42s]  in food
[5179.42s -> 5180.42s]  it really seems
[5180.42s -> 5181.42s]  to decrease
[5181.42s -> 5182.42s]  any chance
[5182.42s -> 5183.42s]  of GI tract
[5183.42s -> 5184.42s]  because you're
[5184.42s -> 5185.42s]  absorbing all
[5185.42s -> 5186.42s]  those other
[5186.42s -> 5187.42s]  nutrients as
[5187.42s -> 5188.42s]  well and so
[5188.42s -> 5189.42s]  when someone
[5189.42s -> 5190.42s]  says I'm
[5190.42s -> 5191.42s]  very sensitive
[5191.42s -> 5192.42s]  to creatine
[5192.42s -> 5193.42s]  and I'm
[5193.42s -> 5194.42s]  not sure
[5194.42s -> 5195.42s]  what that
[5195.42s -> 5196.42s]  is maybe
[5196.42s -> 5197.42s]  they're
[5197.42s -> 5198.42s]  trying to
[5198.42s -> 5199.42s]  get funding
[5199.42s -> 5200.42s]  for that
[5200.42s -> 5201.42s]  would be
[5201.42s -> 5202.42s]  worth us
[5202.42s -> 5203.42s]  being aware
[5203.42s -> 5204.42s]  of?
[5204.42s -> 5205.42s]  Yeah we
[5205.42s -> 5206.42s]  have eight
[5206.42s -> 5207.42s]  planned and
[5207.42s -> 5208.42s]  then we've
[5208.42s -> 5209.42s]  asked the
[5209.42s -> 5210.42s]  federal
[5210.42s -> 5211.42s]  government
[5211.42s -> 5212.42s]  to look at
[5212.42s -> 5213.42s]  creatine
[5213.42s -> 5214.42s]  and home
[5214.42s -> 5215.42s]  based exercise
[5215.42s -> 5216.42s]  in sarcopenic
[5216.42s -> 5217.42s]  adults but
[5217.42s -> 5218.42s]  we're also
[5218.42s -> 5219.42s]  going to be
[5219.42s -> 5220.42s]  looking at that
[5220.42s -> 5221.42s]  in individuals
[5221.42s -> 5222.42s]  and there's
[5222.42s -> 5223.42s]  some new
[5223.42s -> 5224.42s]  studies that
[5224.42s -> 5225.42s]  with these
[5225.42s -> 5226.42s]  therabands
[5226.42s -> 5227.42s]  have been
[5227.42s -> 5228.42s]  shown to be
[5228.42s -> 5229.42s]  effective so
[5229.42s -> 5230.42s]  those are the
[5230.42s -> 5231.42s]  areas and then
[5231.42s -> 5232.42s]  we're finally
[5232.42s -> 5233.42s]  going to answer
[5233.42s -> 5234.42s]  does the timing
[5234.42s -> 5235.42s]  matter we're
[5235.42s -> 5236.42s]  going to look
[5236.42s -> 5237.42s]  at creatine
[5237.42s -> 5238.42s]  on training
[5238.42s -> 5239.42s]  days versus
[5239.42s -> 5240.42s]  just on
[5240.42s -> 5241.42s]  non-training
[5241.42s -> 5242.42s]  days so
[5242.42s -> 5243.42s]  that's going
[5243.42s -> 5244.42s]  to really
[5244.42s -> 5245.42s]  sort of conclude
[5245.42s -> 5246.42s]  does blood
[5246.42s -> 5247.42s]  flow really
[5247.42s -> 5248.42s]  matter and
[5248.42s -> 5249.42s]  those are
[5249.42s -> 5250.42s]  all planned
[5250.42s -> 5251.42s]  out there
[5251.42s -> 5252.42s]  and we're
[5252.42s -> 5253.42s]  going to
[5253.42s -> 5254.42s]  talk about
[5254.42s -> 5255.42s]  that in
[5255.42s -> 5256.42s]  the next
[5256.42s -> 5257.42s]  couple of
[5257.42s -> 5258.42s]  minutes.
[5258.42s -> 5259.42s]  So thank
[5259.42s -> 5260.42s]  you so
[5260.42s -> 5261.42s]  much for
[5261.42s -> 5262.42s]  taking the
[5262.42s -> 5263.42s]  time to
[5263.42s -> 5264.42s]  join us
[5264.42s -> 5265.42s]  today.
