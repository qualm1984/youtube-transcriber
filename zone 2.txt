[0.00s -> 5.36s]  Hey everyone, welcome to The Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Attia.
[9.40s -> 13.68s]  In you go. It is so great to be sitting down with you again. Last time, of course,
[13.72s -> 17.78s]  we did this in person, but these days I've become too lazy to travel around and do podcasts in
[17.78s -> 22.64s]  person. So do it by video. But that said, I really hope you can get out here to Austin so we can
[22.64s -> 29.52s]  train together and do some cool ex-phys. And also I need to get out there to sort of do some of the
[29.52s -> 35.90s]  ex-phys stuff we've talked about. But I almost don't know where to begin because there's so much
[35.90s -> 40.12s]  stuff we talked about last time that we want to double click on this time. There's so much that
[40.12s -> 45.72s]  has changed in the interval from when we spoke, gosh, probably two years ago, a little over two
[45.72s -> 51.02s]  years ago. I thought one place we could pick it up, something we didn't really talk about last
[51.02s -> 57.52s]  time, was your work with Tadi Pogacar. Because of course, I don't think anybody knew who he was
[57.52s -> 59.50s]  two years ago, or two and a half years ago.
[59.52s -> 66.22s]  And of course, now he is, I don't know. I mean, I think it's safe to say he has the potential to
[66.22s -> 71.36s]  potentially go down as the greatest Tour de France cyclist of all time, given how young he is. Not to
[71.36s -> 76.50s]  put that expectation out there, but to win the Tour at such a young age, to not just win the
[76.50s -> 84.10s]  yellow jersey, but the white jersey, the polka dot jersey repeatedly. He looks like something of a
[84.10s -> 89.50s]  different species almost. And I say that not in the way that people typically say,
[89.52s -> 93.92s]  those things of cyclists in a way that's suspicious of anything. So, I don't know,
[93.92s -> 98.96s]  maybe for the listeners who are not familiar with the Tour de France, not familiar with your work
[98.96s -> 106.40s]  with the UAE team and your work with Tadi Pogacar, maybe give folks a little bit of an update as to
[106.40s -> 109.92s]  what you've been doing in professional cycling over the past couple of years.
[109.92s -> 114.48s]  Yeah. Well, first of all, thank you very much for having me here. It's an honor,
[114.48s -> 118.00s]  and I'm really excited for this, and I appreciate the opportunity.
[119.52s -> 127.28s]  I had a lot of fun last time, and I hope to have fun again. Yeah, my work with Tadi started
[128.24s -> 137.60s]  in late 2018 when he signed up for the team. And yeah, I was introduced to him by our CEO,
[138.16s -> 145.04s]  Gianetti, and our general manager, Macin. And they told me, hey, just start working with this guy.
[145.60s -> 147.68s]  And he was what at the time, 19 maybe?
[148.96s -> 149.46s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[149.52s -> 158.96s]  19. He was 19 at the time. Just had turned 19, in fact. And yeah, so I started to work with him,
[158.96s -> 167.12s]  and right away, I realized that he had very good potential. And I think a couple of months
[167.68s -> 173.28s]  earlier, no, or later, I forgot when we had that podcast, I already told you about him.
[176.56s -> 178.96s]  And I told him, yeah, we have a guy that has good potential.
[178.96s -> 181.92s]  He had a lot of good potential. And yeah, that was Tadi.
[182.80s -> 186.24s]  And to put it in perspective, I mean, has good potential
[186.24s -> 192.00s]  is one thing. To then go and do what he did would make that statement the understatement of the
[192.00s -> 198.00s]  century for folks who maybe don't follow cycling as closely, right?
[198.00s -> 201.12s]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I try to be cautious, right? And I don't usually
[201.84s -> 205.12s]  say that a lot of people who have good potential—
[205.12s -> 207.84s]  Yeah. We talked about it over dinner that night, you know?
[207.84s -> 215.82s]  Yeah, yeah. When I say someone has good potential, it's good potential. I don't usually say that lightly of anybody, right?
[215.82s -> 237.06s]  What did you see in him in 2018, 2019, that led you to believe that even amongst that class, because professional cyclists, you know, from a physiologic standpoint are all very special individuals. What did you see in him that made you think he has potential in your understated way?
[237.06s -> 261.08s]  Well, first that the physiological testing that we started doing right off the bat, I saw like that he had amazing capabilities, you know, at the oxidative capabilities, like ability to clear lactate and to put out great amount of power output for long periods of time.
[261.38s -> 266.08s]  So when you say that, was it specifically his FTE?
[267.06s -> 285.26s]  Was it the FTP that impressed you? Or was it his, as you said, lactate clearance, was it shorter bursts of power that were higher than FTP, but the speed with which he could do or the successive repeats that he could do? I mean, tell me some of the testing you were putting cyclists through and how he stood out.
[285.74s -> 297.04s]  So it's kind of like similar test that I did to you, right? And this is kind of like where I saw that at a given power output, his lactate levels.
[297.06s -> 299.28s]  Blood lactate levels were extremely low.
[300.08s -> 313.68s]  And since I've been doing this specific protocol for 20 years with professional athletes, professional cyclists in this specific case, that's where I have my cheat sheet, right?
[313.68s -> 315.90s]  Where I know I can categorize where people are.
[316.46s -> 324.10s]  And that was like, he was like, whoa, wait, on the other side, you know, way above almost everybody that I had tested or around the same category.
[324.68s -> 326.92s]  And for that age, that's what I saw like, whoa.
[327.06s -> 333.74s]  First of all, he is at a different category and his first year pro, he's pretty much a junior.
[335.24s -> 344.28s]  And then that's where like, I could see he could sustain a high amount of power with very low lactate compared to the rest.
[344.28s -> 356.70s]  And then throughout the trainings, looking, we use TrainingPeaks, the software, looking at TrainingPeaks, that's where I would see his different abilities to sustain a given power output.
[357.06s -> 365.24s]  For the whole day or for a specific effort, a glycolytic effort on a climb, and it would see the power output that he would be putting out.
[365.24s -> 381.24s]  And so altogether, then I saw his trainability, how easy he would get the concepts, how easy he would be comfortable with the training, how easy he would recover.
[381.24s -> 384.24s]  I, you know, I like the feedback.
[384.24s -> 386.24s]  I talked to him once, twice a day.
[386.24s -> 386.74s]  And he was very positive.
[387.06s -> 397.44s]  And, you know, over WhatsApp too, you know, the feedback and, you know, I know very well when a hard week is or what a hard week is.
[397.44s -> 402.20s]  And when you see this kid telling you, pretty good, I'm recovering very well.
[402.20s -> 407.06s]  When other ones are telling you, woof, I had to take it a little bit easier today because I couldn't do this effort.
[407.06s -> 409.30s]  And we're talking about high level pros.
[409.30s -> 412.18s]  And you see this kid telling you like, yeah, there's a problem.
[412.18s -> 414.56s]  That's where you start putting together things.
[414.56s -> 416.24s]  And also around the same time.
[416.24s -> 433.62s]  With my two colleagues at the university, Angela D'Alessandro and Travis Nenkov, we developed, we started to develop in a platform for metabolomics where we can look at, you know, hundreds, if not thousands of metabolites in the human body.
[433.62s -> 439.62s]  And we did it at the Tour of California in 2019, which was like around April.
[439.62s -> 441.62s]  That's where he won it.
[441.62s -> 444.24s]  And that's where when we analyze all his metabolites.
[444.24s -> 445.24s]  And we did already.
[445.24s -> 446.24s]  Yeah.
[446.24s -> 449.24s]  We did it at the training camp in January of 2019.
[449.24s -> 460.24s]  And we already saw, wow, this guy has different metabolites, you know, at the glycolytic level, oxidative level, recovery level.
[460.24s -> 463.24s]  And we confirmed that at the Tour of California.
[463.24s -> 468.24s]  And this is where putting it all together, you know, I saw like, yeah, this guy is different.
[468.24s -> 475.24s]  So going back to what you said about lactate, I assume that one of the data points that is most telling of a cyclist is.
[475.24s -> 489.24s]  If you plot on the X axis watts per kilo and on the Y axis lactate production, that would be a very, I mean, that might be one of the most telling graphs you could generate.
[489.24s -> 490.24s]  Yeah.
[490.24s -> 491.24s]  To predict success.
[491.24s -> 492.24s]  Yeah.
[492.24s -> 493.24s]  In the, in the Tour, correct?
[493.24s -> 494.24s]  Absolutely.
[494.24s -> 495.24s]  Absolutely.
[495.24s -> 501.24s]  You see someone at, you know, for example, a normal tempo climbing in the Tour de France.
[501.24s -> 503.24s]  Tempo, ah, that is the whole peloton going up.
[503.24s -> 504.24s]  It's got to be.
[504.24s -> 505.24s]  It's about five watts per kilo.
[505.24s -> 506.24s]  Is it?
[506.24s -> 507.24s]  I was about to say, wow.
[507.24s -> 508.24s]  Yeah.
[508.24s -> 509.24s]  I was going to say four and a half.
[509.24s -> 510.24s]  Okay.
[510.24s -> 511.24s]  So, wow.
[511.24s -> 512.24s]  The whole peloton is going up at five watts per kilo.
[512.24s -> 513.24s]  Yeah.
[513.24s -> 514.24s]  Something like that.
[514.24s -> 519.24s]  And that's what you see, like someone at that intensity might have already six millimoles.
[519.24s -> 520.24s]  Yes.
[520.24s -> 526.24s]  So you can tell it's going to be very tasking and others might have one resting levels, you know?
[526.24s -> 531.24s]  And this is where like, this is, it really, really predicts performance.
[531.24s -> 536.24s]  And you can really predict performance in an incredible way.
[536.24s -> 541.96s]  In fact, when we go to these training camps, like I'm going to go next week for the first
[541.96s -> 549.02s]  training camp of the year with the team, we do this physiological testing and I do this
[549.02s -> 551.34s]  protocol and I get this data.
[551.34s -> 557.04s]  So right away I tell the team managers, this guy is way above the rest.
[557.04s -> 561.24s]  These three guys are really, really good immediately behind it.
[561.24s -> 564.92s]  These two guys are the third level.
[564.92s -> 570.48s]  And then we have all these guys that they're like really, really bad form and it pretty
[570.48s -> 571.48s]  much works.
[571.48s -> 578.24s]  You know, then we do different training, racing simulation and the telebook right away.
[578.24s -> 579.64s]  This is, this is how it is.
[579.64s -> 581.24s]  So this is why it's very predictive.
[581.24s -> 586.12s]  And the same thing too, moving into the season, you see, okay, all these three guys are going
[586.12s -> 588.88s]  to be at a very good level when we start the season.
[588.88s -> 591.24s]  This guy who we thought that he was going to be a very good.
[591.24s -> 592.24s]  Good level.
[592.24s -> 594.08s]  He's not there at all.
[594.08s -> 600.80s]  So and that when the season starts, you see that it reflects very well what's going to
[600.80s -> 601.80s]  happen.
[601.80s -> 602.80s]  Yeah.
[602.80s -> 603.80s]  That's one of the things about cycling that I really love.
[603.80s -> 607.72s]  I mean, I don't know if you saw, but I interviewed Lance Armstrong back in, oh gosh, probably
[607.72s -> 609.68s]  back in June or maybe it came out in September.
[609.68s -> 617.20s]  But you know, one of the things that we talked about was both on and off EPO or blood transfusions.
[617.20s -> 620.68s]  You sort of knew where you stood before the race.
[620.68s -> 624.32s]  The, the whole thing was based on your FTP in Watts per kilo.
[624.32s -> 632.00s]  So, you know, when he was, he talked about when he was off, EPO, he could hold 450 Watts
[632.00s -> 633.00s]  for 30 minutes.
[633.00s -> 634.62s]  So that would be slightly below FTP.
[634.62s -> 637.54s]  That'd be slightly above FTP at 70.
[637.54s -> 643.06s]  I think he was 70 to 75 kilos, but it was in the ballpark of six Watts per kilo.
[643.06s -> 648.14s]  And then of course on EPO, it was 7.1 Watts per kilo, a huge difference, but you knew
[648.14s -> 649.24s]  that number going in.
[649.24s -> 650.24s]  Yeah.
[650.24s -> 655.76s]  sort of knew like only the GC contenders could do that. I think that's the thing that a lot of
[655.76s -> 661.78s]  people don't understand about cycling, which is there's relatively few moments in the tour when
[661.78s -> 668.64s]  you need to sustain that level, but they always occur at the most important strategic times,
[668.68s -> 673.32s]  right? And that's sort of where the race is won and lost because the race is won and lost by
[673.32s -> 679.64s]  minutes. It's for a race that is, how many hours does it take to complete the tour? 100 hours or
[679.64s -> 685.04s]  something? That's a good question. Um, um, yeah, an average of about five, four and a half,
[685.12s -> 691.64s]  five hours a day. Yeah. So it's about a hundred hour race. And yet the difference between the
[691.64s -> 698.10s]  first, second, third guy will be in some cases, seconds, in some cases, a few minutes for someone
[698.10s -> 704.54s]  to win by five minutes is considered a blowout. And it, and, and so what it really tells you is
[704.54s -> 709.22s]  that there are a handful of minutes in that race. There are a handful of climbs and time trials
[709.22s -> 709.62s]  that you can do. And so it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[709.62s -> 715.26s]  that set apart the winners from everybody else. And that's, to me, that's one of the beautiful
[715.26s -> 720.30s]  things about cycling physiology is you have these metrics. And now I think it's not just FTP,
[720.30s -> 727.58s]  it's Watts per kilo with at lactate production. So it gets even more into kind of the critical
[727.58s -> 734.06s]  physiology of recovery. Yeah. And in fact, we use this metrics a lot, um, uh, for the competition
[734.06s -> 739.36s]  and we, we did it this year, the, through the friends. So knowing, uh, the power output,
[739.36s -> 745.98s]  that he could sustain for, as, as you very well said for specific times, um, um, and, and climbs,
[746.16s -> 753.18s]  we knew his capabilities. And one of the things that, uh, we, we, we knew was that, uh, in the
[753.18s -> 759.42s]  Alps, he was at a very, very high level. So, uh, you know, like that famous stage where he broke
[759.42s -> 766.88s]  away and called the Rome, uh, 35 kilometers to the finish line. We were seeing not only his data,
[766.88s -> 769.30s]  but we see by knowing our riders,
[769.36s -> 777.20s]  data, you can also guess the other writers data too. Right. Um, uh, it's not rocket science. So we
[777.20s -> 782.00s]  knew that he was at a very high level, um, and discussing the tactics, you know, cause it's part
[782.00s -> 786.72s]  of the thing that we do, but we, we observe the data that we have, uh, the data that we think the
[786.72s -> 793.84s]  other ones have. And we, we, we structure, uh, uh, strategy for the next day and, Hey, does he
[793.84s -> 799.28s]  have the legs to attack? Uh, should be holding back or what should we do? And clearly it was like,
[799.28s -> 804.96s]  well, tomorrow, if he attacks 35 kilometers to the finish line, he's going to get there with three
[804.96s -> 810.56s]  minutes because the other guys, they're not at that level, you know? So why wait to the end of
[810.56s -> 815.28s]  the tour where we can try to solve the situation. So we knew his capabilities very well and
[815.28s -> 821.68s]  discussing this with him and the, and the manager. Um, yeah, that was the, the, the, the strategy
[821.68s -> 827.28s]  first test the legs. And like, I, if you had in fact, good legs, boom, go for it. And that's
[827.28s -> 829.04s]  exactly what he did. Yeah.
[829.28s -> 834.80s]  How much of that are you going to determine after a night of sleep, right? Where you say,
[834.80s -> 839.28s]  we're going to look at his resting lactate first thing in the morning. We're going to look at his
[839.28s -> 842.40s]  heart rate overnight. We're going to look at his heart rate variability overnight.
[843.12s -> 848.00s]  So in addition to the subjective, for example, how he felt during the previous day's
[848.00s -> 853.60s]  attacks, coupled with some of that objective data, does that partially formulate the strategy also,
[853.60s -> 858.56s]  or is it mostly based on historical data from training where you say,
[859.28s -> 865.20s]  I know that when he's at this many Watts per kilo for this many minutes, he has the capacity to
[865.20s -> 865.76s]  recover.
[866.64s -> 873.04s]  Yeah. I think it's more of the, the ladder, right. Where we have, uh, um, all that physiological
[873.04s -> 881.52s]  data, that, that, and the trends and how it is. And what we see at this level, um, these guys,
[881.52s -> 888.00s]  they're so good at ignoring their feelings. You know, um, sometimes it's just kind of how they
[888.00s -> 888.56s]  wake up.
[889.28s -> 895.12s]  You know, his capabilities. So if he wakes up fresh and say, hi, how are you doing today?
[895.12s -> 902.16s]  Like, oh yeah, I slept like a baby, like boom, then you're ready, you know? Um, and sometimes,
[902.16s -> 908.16s]  yeah, it's just, we try not to focus on many other metrics the day off because we have already
[908.16s -> 914.56s]  things and, and, and sometimes, you know, heart rate variability, um, you know, it might not
[914.56s -> 919.04s]  be very precise, uh, and we don't want to get then put some ideas.
[919.28s -> 924.96s]  And in fact, speaking with him, you know, um, and I'm going to mention any brand or anything,
[924.96s -> 930.24s]  but looking at heart rate variability someday, he said like, look today, he told me that I was
[930.24s -> 936.96s]  fatigued, that algorithm. And I went out there and beat my record. Right. And, um, and the clients,
[936.96s -> 941.44s]  obviously I'm not fatigued, you know, and other, other days it tells you you're in top form and,
[941.44s -> 943.92s]  and, ah, I feel a little more fatigued, you know?
[943.92s -> 949.04s]  So this is what these algorithms, we, we, we need to be careful sometimes and, and my work,
[949.28s -> 955.52s]  maybe general population, but with this type of athletes, um, um, I, I, at this level, I really
[955.52s -> 961.36s]  feel that it's better once you have all the work done and, uh, and they know, you know, you, you
[961.36s -> 966.32s]  know, their capabilities, like, are you ready to go? You know, it's like, it's like a top, uh,
[966.32s -> 972.80s]  performing performer, performer at a theater, right? Is like, you have worked very hard.
[973.36s -> 977.44s]  Now it's up to like, are you ready to go? You know, do you have a good night's sleep?
[977.44s -> 978.48s]  Are you ready to perform?
[979.28s -> 981.76s]  Good performance say, yes, I'm ready to go.
[981.76s -> 986.32s]  I agree with you completely, even for me. And I'm not a top level, anything.
[986.32s -> 994.32s]  I have not found the predictors of, you know, readiness to be very accurate or to necessarily
[995.04s -> 1000.16s]  reflect how well I'm going to perform. I've had amazing performances by performances. I mean,
[1000.16s -> 1004.48s]  workouts, right? Like that's, that's the only metric I'm performing in. I've had amazing workouts.
[1005.04s -> 1009.04s]  Um, when my prediction was that it would not be
[1009.04s -> 1009.28s]  good.
[1009.28s -> 1014.00s]  And I've also had the prediction saying you're on top of the world and I
[1014.00s -> 1019.12s]  not performed well. So, um, you know, I wish I could say with more clarity,
[1019.12s -> 1024.32s]  what the frequency of those deviations or discordances are, but I can agree that
[1025.60s -> 1030.16s]  putting the wrong idea in somebody's head when the predictive, when there's nothing
[1030.16s -> 1035.04s]  you can do about it. I mean, that's the other thing too. It's sort of like at best, if it was
[1035.04s -> 1039.04s]  perfectly accurate, it would be great because you could say, look today, maybe we shouldn't attack.
[1039.04s -> 1043.76s]  Today it's damage control day. You know, one of the things I want to ask you about here,
[1044.40s -> 1047.68s]  and you've spoken about this publicly, so it might be that you're just going to restate
[1047.68s -> 1054.40s]  the views that you've shared publicly. Um, but I've always felt that now that we have
[1054.40s -> 1063.52s]  such great transparency from the sort of that high octane era of sort of the maximum, probably
[1063.52s -> 1068.80s]  cheating in cycling, which, you know, in my view is kind of that two decades of the nineties and,
[1068.80s -> 1075.52s]  and 2000s. And we, we pretty much know now what kind of numbers cyclists were putting out when
[1075.52s -> 1080.40s]  they were being assisted by EPO and blood transfusions. And we sort of know that the
[1080.40s -> 1086.80s]  best of the best we're able to put out somewhere between about 6.8 and 7.1 Watts per kilo, uh,
[1086.80s -> 1093.60s]  at FTP. We also know today that cyclists are not doing that, right? Those numbers
[1093.60s -> 1098.56s]  are nowhere to be found in the Peloton. Now that's, that's information you and I,
[1098.80s -> 1105.28s]  share confidentially, right? That's not public knowledge, but I know it, you know it, and
[1105.28s -> 1112.00s]  anyone coaching people at that level know that nobody's putting out 7.1 Watts per kilo.
[1112.00s -> 1115.52s]  You don't need to be at 7.1 Watts per kilo to win the tour today. You could
[1115.52s -> 1122.96s]  probably win the tour today at 6.1 Watts per kilo. Do you think that making that data public
[1123.52s -> 1128.64s]  would put to rest a lot of the criticisms that say the
[1128.64s -> 1128.80s]  cyclists are not going to be able to win the tour today?
[1128.80s -> 1132.88s]  I think that the sport is still, you know, it, they've just found new ways to cheat,
[1132.88s -> 1139.68s]  but it's still basically a dirty sport because I think when you look at the data objectively,
[1139.68s -> 1145.76s]  it would be very hard to say that today, based on what we know from the era when drug use was rampant.
[1145.76s -> 1152.16s]  No, I think you make a very good point. Uh, and, and it's something that, uh, yeah, it, it frustrates
[1152.16s -> 1158.64s]  me, right? When, when people think that they're doing 7 Watts per kilogram, you know, or 7.2, you
[1158.64s -> 1165.36s]  know, um, and then you have the real data from the day. Um, and this is way lower, you know, you see
[1165.36s -> 1172.24s]  like, you know, for example, like the short climbs where they would do maybe 7.2, now they're doing
[1172.24s -> 1180.64s]  6.3 maybe. And the longer climbs, uh, they're doing 5.5, 5.8. Um, so it, it frustrates me
[1180.64s -> 1186.16s]  because I see this data and like, and I always like, gosh, I wish I could just boom, release it.
[1186.16s -> 1188.48s]  Um, and I, I, that,
[1189.28s -> 1196.00s]  I have, I have absolutely no problem. Uh, I know Tadej has no problem with that. It is more of that.
[1196.00s -> 1200.72s]  Uh, and, and we debated it with the team. Let's do it, you know, like, why, why keeping all this?
[1200.72s -> 1205.76s]  At the end of the day, people can figure that out. Uh, uh, and some people, when I, when I see on
[1205.76s -> 1211.60s]  internet, cause you can see the pie, you know, like the weight of the cyclist, uh, the, um,
[1211.60s -> 1217.84s]  the grade of the climb, the grade, when it starts, the time, um, and the wind, you know, you can be
[1217.84s -> 1218.48s]  very accurate.
[1218.48s -> 1222.48s]  Uh, knowing that, and, and, and I, and I see some people they're quite accurate internet,
[1222.48s -> 1226.72s]  but I see other ones are all over the map. You know, otherwise they say, oh, I did the formula
[1226.72s -> 1232.32s]  and it's 7.2. Like, my gosh, I wish I could show him, hey, this is the real data that we're seeing.
[1233.04s -> 1240.88s]  But I, I, I guess like two, two points there is like one, uh, um, it's, um, um, private data that
[1241.44s -> 1246.96s]  the team considers like not release it. That's, that's team policy. But the other one too is like,
[1246.96s -> 1252.00s]  you know, even if you release that data, there are always going to be people that are not going
[1252.00s -> 1257.44s]  to believe you or they might say, oh, they, they probably altering the data or they're,
[1257.44s -> 1263.04s]  they're tricking it somehow, you know, or putting more weight to the data. So it looks like there's
[1263.04s -> 1269.60s]  less power output. And I know, and I don't know if it's, it'll be an endless fight, you know? Um,
[1269.60s -> 1275.76s]  uh, but I don't know, it's, I, I don't have the answer. Uh, I just, I just have that frustration
[1275.76s -> 1276.80s]  that I wish that I could, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[1276.80s -> 1281.84s]  I could really show that that I, and people can't, can see it, you know, but, but, uh, but
[1282.56s -> 1286.32s]  there's always going to be someone who not going to believe it and going to make a lot of noise out
[1286.32s -> 1293.44s]  of that. Um, but, um, yeah. But the other, that's the other thing too, is like other teams and
[1293.44s -> 1298.96s]  other writers are, are releasing their data. Right. So by releasing their data, you can see
[1298.96s -> 1303.68s]  pretty much where, where Pogacar is, you know, like, oh, okay. If it's a minute ahead or 30
[1303.68s -> 1306.32s]  minute seconds, or sometimes with the same time,
[1306.80s -> 1318.54s]  You can see, you know, like, whoa, if whatever the writer has done and has entered in Pogacar's group or 30 seconds later and has done 5.9, Pogacar is going to be in that neighborhood, right?
[1319.20s -> 1321.48s]  Not going to be seven, you know, with 30 seconds ahead.
[1321.48s -> 1336.36s]  You know, in the spirit of releasing data, the other thing it would potentially do, especially if you could see it in real time, I don't know if you watch Formula One, but one of the things about Formula One that I think the sport has been able to do because of the advances in technology,
[1336.80s -> 1340.38s]  is make more of the data available to the viewer.
[1340.76s -> 1347.94s]  So if you're watching Lewis Hamilton driving a lap, you know, you see what he sees now.
[1348.08s -> 1351.62s]  You can see, and it's not like the end of the world data, but you see his speed.
[1351.74s -> 1353.14s]  You see what gear he's in.
[1353.20s -> 1355.82s]  You see the difference between throttle and brake pressure.
[1356.30s -> 1365.24s]  They could show even more data, certainly, and someone who drives would appreciate it if you really saw brake bias and if you saw brake pressure and lock up and things like that.
[1365.24s -> 1366.78s]  And you can hear the.
[1366.80s -> 1369.24s]  Drivers speaking with their race engineers.
[1369.24s -> 1373.52s]  So, you know, it basically allows you to come more and more into what they're doing.
[1373.52s -> 1377.96s]  This year they introduced a new camera angle, which is what the driver sees.
[1377.96s -> 1385.70s]  And I think it's fantastic because historically you see above them and it looks so smooth, but that's not at all what it feels like to be in a race car.
[1385.70s -> 1392.06s]  So now they just literally put like a camera at their shoulder and now you see how restrictive the halo is.
[1392.06s -> 1395.48s]  You see the bumps and it looks a lot faster.
[1395.96s -> 1396.60s]  You know, I've had this.
[1396.60s -> 1410.76s]  Discussion with a number of people, which is if you could show the same sort of information in cycling, if every time the camera went over to a cyclist, you saw their heart rate, their Watts per kilo, their speed, you know, all of these other things.
[1410.76s -> 1414.52s]  And you could hear some of the communications back and forth with their teams.
[1415.04s -> 1417.52s]  Yes, that changes the sport strategically.
[1417.52s -> 1426.58s]  Now you have to be careful what you say on the radio, but it also allows you to see kind of the human element of this sport a little bit more.
[1426.60s -> 1434.54s]  Do you think that will ever happen where you'll be able to flip on the Tour de France and you'll be able to actually see real-time physiology?
[1434.54s -> 1436.72s]  I would love to see that that day.
[1436.72s -> 1440.56s]  I would love it because I, it would be so much fun, right.
[1440.56s -> 1441.76s]  For the, for the viewer.
[1441.76s -> 1452.80s]  And, and as you see, I mean, cycling has so many possibilities, you know, to engage people more and be fascinated by the physiology and looking at these numbers.
[1452.80s -> 1455.52s]  You know, there, there's this.
[1455.52s -> 1455.76s]  Yeah.
[1455.76s -> 1461.32s]  It's already in a way, you know, you see some cameras already installed in the front, in the back.
[1461.70s -> 1464.28s]  So it's called with Vellon, right.
[1464.28s -> 1474.00s]  So you can see really cool when that, I mean, images when they're preparing a sprint, that is like what, what feels inside and you can see it's really scary.
[1474.00s -> 1485.24s]  Sometimes you can appreciate how difficult it is to, to be at, you know, like a 40 miles an hour sprinting or 35 miles an hour leading to a sprint or, or in a descent.
[1485.24s -> 1485.74s]  Or session.
[1485.76s -> 1487.14s]  Or 70 mile an hour descent.
[1487.14s -> 1489.38s]  70 mile an hour descent, exactly.
[1489.38s -> 1494.30s]  And then you can see the power also output in real time.
[1494.30s -> 1499.38s]  It's still in that, I think it's a great step.
[1499.38s -> 1507.42s]  You don't see in all the riders, but it's estimation, only the riders who wear that Vellon or the Vellon decides to do that.
[1507.42s -> 1513.28s]  I think that they're still not doing that with all the top contenders, but I think it's a first step.
[1513.28s -> 1515.70s]  And, and, and obviously having spoken with.
[1515.70s -> 1519.66s]  Them, but maybe it's like, Hey, let's, let's see, let's see what's, what's the feedback.
[1519.66s -> 1521.52s]  And I think that people are loving it.
[1521.52s -> 1531.24s]  And I, and I would expect that this will increase, you know, and, and I mean, I would love at some point, you know, and as you know, very well in the world of biosensors, right.
[1531.24s -> 1538.22s]  It's going to revolutionize sports where we're going to be able to see, you know, so many different parameters.
[1538.22s -> 1544.78s]  Imagine you could see lactate and glucose in real time, which of course is technologically feasible already.
[1544.78s -> 1545.24s]  So it's just.
[1545.24s -> 1546.90s]  A question of, yeah.
[1546.90s -> 1547.40s]  Yeah.
[1547.40s -> 1547.82s]  Yeah.
[1547.82s -> 1551.24s]  So this, I think that would love for, for all sports too, right.
[1551.24s -> 1555.00s]  Imagine you can see an NBA, a basketball game, right.
[1555.00s -> 1559.16s]  And see that the lactator of, of LeBron James compared to the other ones.
[1559.16s -> 1559.44s]  Right.
[1559.44s -> 1565.94s]  I mean, I would love to see that as a spectator and I hope that someday we were able to see these parameters.
[1567.12s -> 1571.32s]  So last thing on the, on the tour, um, talk to me about Vontu this year.
[1571.36s -> 1574.16s]  What, what, that was a, that was a tough stage.
[1574.48s -> 1575.12s]  Um.
[1575.58s -> 1580.54s]  Also, I mean, kind of showed, it looked like his toughest stage.
[1580.54s -> 1581.86s]  Was that, is that a fair assessment?
[1582.44s -> 1583.44s]  Yes, probably.
[1583.58s -> 1583.86s]  Yeah.
[1584.20s -> 1587.36s]  And, and what's amazing I think is the poise on that stage.
[1587.48s -> 1596.74s]  Um, it, it's hard to tell if he was really struggling on the ascent of Vontu or he was just deciding strategically, I'm going to conserve a little bit of energy here.
[1596.94s -> 1598.48s]  What was your take on that?
[1598.48s -> 1599.58s]  Or what can you say about that?
[1599.66s -> 1604.62s]  Well, it was, it was a very difficult climb, um, and, and a very long climb.
[1604.62s -> 1625.74s]  So, um, you know, Tade, his mentality is wired, you know, like a champion and, and, and he, when someone goes and they were full gas in the last part, when, uh, when he got attacked and, and, you know, Tade knew that, okay, this is, this is not going to be the, the top of Vontu is not going to be the, uh, the end of the stage.
[1625.74s -> 1626.00s]  Right.
[1626.00s -> 1627.92s]  I have a long descent where I couldn't make it out.
[1627.92s -> 1628.78s]  Very, very long descent.
[1629.28s -> 1633.08s]  And, and I have some partners with me, you know, that they can help me out.
[1633.58s -> 1634.60s]  Uh, so I'm not going to.
[1634.60s -> 1658.68s]  I'm not going to panic at all, but I'm not going to also try to, uh, uh, waste a lot of energy, um, because I need to now be, I have, and he also had a big, uh, gap, you know, uh, the whole different thing would have been if he had 20 seconds, but having a big gap and knowing that you have a big descent and how calm he is, uh, that's one thing that, um, it's a very important strategy.
[1658.68s -> 1661.44s]  And this is probably, you know, this, this is what happened.
[1661.44s -> 1664.44s]  Um, I have, uh, you know, this reminds me.
[1664.60s -> 1677.22s]  In a way, what happened the first year that he was pro when he was 19 at the tour of California, um, uh, it was the, the previous stage before, um, um, what's called Bear Lake.
[1677.26s -> 1678.56s]  Not what is the mountain Burlick?
[1678.56s -> 1679.20s]  I think it's Burlick.
[1679.20s -> 1679.32s]  Yeah.
[1679.32s -> 1685.52s]  Is that is the top mountain right in, in the tour of California, uh, where it's going to be decided.
[1685.56s -> 1693.10s]  So the day before, uh, two cyclists, George Bennett and Editha attacked in a, in a short, but very steep climb.
[1693.56s -> 1694.60s]  Um, and they were only.
[1694.60s -> 1704.26s]  12 riders left and Editha and Bennett attacked, uh, then there was like a descent and a long highway all the way to the finish line.
[1704.26s -> 1707.14s]  So there was plenty of time to, to cut, to catch them up.
[1707.14s -> 1716.14s]  But, um, Tyler didn't follow them up, you know, another rider would have just followed their wheel and Tyler decided, no, I'm not going to follow them.
[1716.48s -> 1720.64s]  We have time and I'm going to take the chance, uh, cause I'm confident for tomorrow.
[1721.10s -> 1722.48s]  And, and, and, and when I asked them.
[1722.48s -> 1726.86s]  Uh, as, as soon as he crossed the finish line, I asked him, are you okay?
[1727.24s -> 1731.98s]  Uh, why, why did you, why you didn't, um, um, follow their attack?
[1732.40s -> 1738.82s]  And he said, well, I, I just wanted, uh, I wanted to know who is going to be good tomorrow.
[1739.28s -> 1745.56s]  So I know those two guys are going to be good tomorrow, but I wanted to take my time and see the other 10 guys, how they're breathing.
[1745.64s -> 1752.28s]  What's their body language and, uh, take my time to observe, uh, to, to start preparing my strategy for tomorrow.
[1752.82s -> 1754.02s]  And in fact, that's what he did.
[1754.06s -> 1759.06s]  Um, so they were then caught up, you know, like two, three kilometers to the finish line.
[1759.06s -> 1762.48s]  So all those 12, 13 guys, whatever they were, they got together.
[1762.48s -> 1766.60s]  And the next day, in fact, he noticed there was two guys attacked.
[1766.86s -> 1769.44s]  He just followed them and he just eliminated one by one.
[1769.94s -> 1776.86s]  But, uh, that, that's what, that's how this guy thinks, you know, uh, his strategy, like no panic, plenty of time today.
[1777.10s -> 1779.44s]  I have a good gap in the GC.
[1779.78s -> 1781.36s]  Why am I going to go full gas?
[1781.44s -> 1782.40s]  Uh, when I know.
[1782.40s -> 1794.70s]  I know that he is going to go full gas and, and he might lose energy for tomorrow, uh, because he might pay for this at this time of the, of the, to the friends, and we have plenty of time to, to, to catch him up.
[1795.02s -> 1798.06s]  Um, so that's kind of the strategy that he had too.
[1798.40s -> 1806.82s]  How much time does someone like Teddy spend in zone two, which we're going to talk a lot about, right?
[1806.82s -> 1810.86s]  So, um, and let's do it more as percentage of training time.
[1810.86s -> 1811.36s]  Cause I think.
[1811.36s -> 1811.86s]  Absolute.
[1811.86s -> 1812.36s]  Numbers.
[1812.36s -> 1816.20s]  Will be very large given that that's his job.
[1816.48s -> 1824.44s]  But when you think about the percentage of time he spends in that energy zone, how does it change over the course of the year?
[1824.44s -> 1836.36s]  So presumably during the winter months, a greater amount of his time would be spent there as he's base building, uh, right before a race when he's kind of sharpening, maybe less, but what would be the range of time?
[1836.98s -> 1837.32s]  Yeah.
[1837.32s -> 1838.16s]  Percent rather.
[1838.16s -> 1838.36s]  Yeah.
[1838.36s -> 1839.06s]  Great question.
[1839.06s -> 1841.98s]  So yeah, when, and you're right when, when we talk about.
[1841.98s -> 1850.74s]  Percentage is, is more, I, I like to, to put it this way, more like a percentage of days dedicated, you know, to cultivate that energy system.
[1850.98s -> 1851.28s]  Right.
[1851.28s -> 1856.86s]  Um, obviously if you put in, in just every single minute together, right.
[1857.60s -> 1860.48s]  The, you know, like the majority is going to be that, right.
[1860.74s -> 1862.10s]  But I would say more in days.
[1862.18s -> 1869.06s]  Um, uh, so, and then the, you know, so yeah, in, in the winter months might be about 80%.
[1869.56s -> 1869.90s]  Wow.
[1869.90s -> 1871.94s]  Of the, of the, of the 70 to 80%.
[1871.98s -> 1881.74s]  Um, and then the, of the 70 to 80% of the days, as the season gets closer, he starts increasing more intensity days and sessions, and then just, did you have, you started the season?
[1882.06s -> 1887.14s]  So, uh, when they started the season racing and you have, it depends, right.
[1887.14s -> 1895.94s]  You, you might have one, one stage race of five, seven days, and then you have a five day block or one week to recover and they have the next stage rate.
[1895.94s -> 1898.14s]  So in that week, we do a lot of recovery.
[1898.32s -> 1900.06s]  We might do some sessions here and there.
[1900.48s -> 1901.98s]  Um, and then, uh, after.
[1902.32s -> 1915.86s]  A few blocks of, um, um, races, that's where you have another long time to train period to train, uh, going to altitude towards the tour of France or, or towards the next goal.
[1916.18s -> 1923.68s]  And that's where you may revisit, you know, uh, those, these different energy systems and, uh, in train specifically.
[1924.14s -> 1930.68s]  But, uh, but yeah, we, we, we alternate and, and, and I think it's, it's, it's energy system has a time.
[1931.36s -> 1931.94s]  In the year.
[1932.28s -> 1938.06s]  And, uh, in the calendar where it's built, um, in order to try to achieve what we want.
[1939.02s -> 1948.02s]  So let's remind people now with this, you know, uh, I've put out a few posts on social over gosh, the past year, and even in the past little while.
[1948.56s -> 1955.68s]  And anytime I'm talking about zone two, it's really one of the topics that generates the most curiosity, the most, the most inquiry from people.
[1955.68s -> 1959.94s]  I think people really intuitively kind of resonate with this.
[1960.22s -> 1961.94s]  And then of course, a million questions.
[1961.94s -> 1965.48s]  Follow because there's, there's so much minutiae and detail around it.
[1965.48s -> 1974.40s]  And, and a lot of that we're going to cover today, but let's start from a place of maybe someone hasn't heard the first podcast where we go through some of the semantics of this.
[1975.40s -> 1977.02s]  Define zone two.
[1977.74s -> 1978.24s]  Okay.
[1978.90s -> 1979.06s]  Okay.
[1979.06s -> 1982.14s]  So, um, zone two Z two, right.
[1982.18s -> 1986.10s]  Um, I started using it like about 25 years ago.
[1986.18s -> 1990.74s]  Um, and I just have a very simple, um, name.
[1990.82s -> 1991.24s]  So two.
[1991.94s -> 2004.06s]  Um, it is from my, um, point of view, it is the exercise intensity at the one you are stressing the mitochondria and oxidative capacity to the most.
[2004.44s -> 2007.90s]  Uh, this is where you're recruiting mainly type one muscle fibers.
[2008.48s -> 2019.24s]  This is where you are mobilizing the highest amount of fat, um, both from lipolysis from maripose tissue, as well from fat oxidation inside of my kind of the mitochondria.
[2019.78s -> 2021.28s]  And this is also.
[2021.28s -> 2030.16s]  Where, um, uh, you stimulate all those, uh, energy that entered that bioenergetics, which is, um, oxidative phosphorylation.
[2030.24s -> 2039.36s]  This is where you burn, uh, both the, uh, products, the fat inside of mitochondria, as well as the glucose inside the mitochondria.
[2039.36s -> 2051.16s]  There's not a very high glycolytic flux that, um, it's going to be transformed into pyruvate and reduced to lactate, but that flux still is, uh, oxidized inside mitochondria.
[2051.28s -> 2059.44s]  And, uh, this is looking at, from bioenergetics standpoint, this is what I would consider the zone two.
[2059.82s -> 2075.16s]  And what I have seen is that throughout the years is that this is the exercise intensity that, um, um, achieves or, uh, stimulates that mitochondrial function and fat oxidation and lactate cleanse capacity the most.
[2075.70s -> 2077.78s]  Cause, um, that's the other thing too.
[2078.20s -> 2081.16s]  This is where, um, there are other things involved.
[2081.16s -> 2081.28s]  In.
[2081.28s -> 2081.94s]  Lactate.
[2082.04s -> 2084.90s]  So lactate is a great fuel to the cells.
[2085.36s -> 2090.58s]  It's in fact, it's probably the preferred fuel for the cells, for most cells in the body.
[2091.12s -> 2096.70s]  This is a work that my colleague and mentor and friend, uh, George Brooks discovered, right.
[2096.76s -> 2099.82s]  Um, could have, you should have him someday in the podcast.
[2099.82s -> 2101.10s]  Cause he's fascinating.
[2101.10s -> 2110.48s]  I mean, he, he, I mean, I, I would not be surprised if someday soon we hear that, um, um, he, uh, he, he will, he, he wins the Nobel prize.
[2110.48s -> 2111.10s]  He's amazing.
[2111.28s -> 2121.60s]  I, I, and, and every time I talk to him, I'm still learn a lot of things and that I've been translating a lot of his research, but, um, but yeah, that's how I see that.
[2121.62s -> 2122.04s]  Yeah.
[2122.04s -> 2130.00s]  You know, you, you have, um, within the mitochondrial function, you see how lactate is oxidizing the mitochondria back to energy, right.
[2130.00s -> 2141.12s]  So, um, and that happens at that, uh, in those muscle fiber types, those muscle fiber types and the mitochondria, those fiber fiber types also develop, um, these.
[2141.12s -> 2150.00s]  These transporters, which are MCT ones, which are the ones is the, that transport lactate inside the cell and inside mitochondria.
[2150.48s -> 2156.66s]  So when you stimulate that training zone, you stimulate all these energy systems and the components that come with them.
[2156.72s -> 2163.86s]  So let's talk about the different ways that one can go about estimating this based on the definition you've just given.
[2164.30s -> 2170.80s]  It seems to me that the purest way to estimate this would be via indirect calorimetry.
[2171.16s -> 2174.28s]  Because that will actually tell us the fat oxidation.
[2174.84s -> 2176.28s]  Is that, is that a fair assessment?
[2176.58s -> 2178.14s]  Yes, it's a very good assessment.
[2178.20s -> 2184.26s]  And, uh, and, and, and that usually exactly that, that, that usually correlates with the, uh, the fat max.
[2184.30s -> 2185.64s]  That's how we, we call it too.
[2185.64s -> 2185.88s]  Right.
[2185.88s -> 2188.10s]  That's, uh, with, with fat oxidation.
[2188.10s -> 2200.76s]  And when you see that you start oxidizing fat and my increasing in cases and gets to a point that is, uh, it maxed out, which is the fat max, and then it starts going down sharply.
[2201.66s -> 2201.88s]  Right.
[2201.88s -> 2203.70s]  As exercise intensity increases.
[2204.48s -> 2206.40s]  So, so let's tell people how that's measured.
[2206.40s -> 2209.80s]  Cause I think it's, um, we do this with all of our patients.
[2210.18s -> 2222.42s]  Um, and I find it to be not that easy to explain because there's some physiology involved and there's some math involved, but let me try to see if I can explain this to folks.
[2222.42s -> 2231.10s]  So, uh, you know, you, you hook me up to an indirect calorimeter, so you're going to put a, uh, a little plug on my nose.
[2231.12s -> 2234.96s]  You're going to put a, um, uh, a mask over my nose and mouth.
[2235.30s -> 2242.78s]  That mask has the ability to measure the amount of oxygen that I consume because it has a sensor for O2.
[2243.06s -> 2247.72s]  So it knows that the O2 that's coming in is at 21%.
[2247.72s -> 2253.44s]  The air is coming in at 21% O2 and whatever I exhale is the difference between that.
[2253.56s -> 2258.52s]  So you can now tell how much O2 was consumed and you can have a similar sensor for carbon dioxide.
[2258.68s -> 2260.24s]  So you know how much carbon dioxide is produced.
[2260.24s -> 2260.52s]  So.
[2261.12s -> 2268.76s]  It's very easy to measure consumed oxygen and produced carbon dioxide, provided you can completely isolate around the nose and the mouth.
[2269.20s -> 2269.64s]  Yeah.
[2269.64s -> 2281.08s]  As you hook a person up to some form of ergometer, usually a bike, but could be a treadmill or rowing machine or something like that, you can increase the demand on the muscle.
[2281.30s -> 2284.08s]  So you increase the wattage or the speed or the something.
[2285.90s -> 2291.10s]  You then get out these numbers, VO2 and VCO2, which are what we just said.
[2291.12s -> 2291.68s]  We just talked about.
[2291.92s -> 2294.68s]  So consumption of oxygen, production of carbon dioxide.
[2295.80s -> 2301.16s]  These numbers fit into a relatively straightforward linear equation called the Weir equation.
[2301.48s -> 2304.42s]  And it tells you three things.
[2304.64s -> 2310.22s]  It tells you total energy consumption in kilocalories per minute.
[2310.62s -> 2321.10s]  And then the ratio of VO2 and VCO2 tell you how much of that energy is coming from fat oxidation and how much of it is glycolytic.
[2322.10s -> 2322.66s]  Yeah.
[2322.80s -> 2330.80s]  So at any moment in time, you can look at a VCO2 and a VO2, which are usually measured in liters per minute.
[2331.20s -> 2341.34s]  And you can convert that into a total grams of fat oxidation and a total grams of glucose oxidation per minute.
[2341.64s -> 2342.20s]  Yeah.
[2342.20s -> 2347.76s]  And so you could then plot on the X axis work or power.
[2348.28s -> 2350.84s]  And on the Y axis, you could plot.
[2351.52s -> 2352.32s]  Fat oxidation.
[2353.66s -> 2364.50s]  So, again, describe for people what the shape of that curve looks like and what differentiates Pogacar from the average human being.
[2364.50s -> 2364.96s]  Yeah.
[2365.12s -> 2367.36s]  So, again, I mean, you explained it very well.
[2368.20s -> 2379.42s]  And, yeah, those are based on stoichiometric equations, based on how the combustion of carbohydrates and fatty acids are done in the body.
[2379.80s -> 2380.40s]  This.
[2381.12s -> 2382.80s]  This is a shown in the post-apocalyptic world, right?
[2382.80s -> 2384.88s]  So the Pogacar was rings of the IX of drank or of the X of iron.
[2384.88s -> 2388.16s]  So this curve is a similar curve, the Pogacar was an X of oxygen.
[2388.16s -> 2390.16s]  So this is directly related to the Pogacar.
[2390.16s -> 2391.90s]  So, basically, it's the answer.
[2391.90s -> 2393.70s]  So we have these three companies in the middle.
[2393.70s -> 2397.24s]  So you can see here you have the main company, we have the main company, which is the Pogacar.
[2397.24s -> 2403.02s]  We also have this one company, which is the Pogacar.
[2403.02s -> 2406.06s]  And then, what happened to these two?
[2406.06s -> 2407.08s]  Right.
[2407.08s -> 2408.10s]  So, Pogacar was the...
[2408.10s -> 2409.48s]  You know, they're both the same.
[2409.48s -> 2409.78s]  Right.
[2409.78s -> 2409.98s]  Right.
[2409.98s -> 2410.06s]  Right.
[2410.06s -> 2410.12s]  Right.
[2410.12s -> 2410.18s]  Right.
[2410.18s -> 2410.32s]  Right.
[2410.32s -> 2410.36s]  Right.
[2410.36s -> 2410.60s]  Right.
[2410.60s -> 2410.84s]  Right.
[2410.84s -> 2410.92s]  Right.
[2410.92s -> 2410.94s]  Right.
[2410.94s -> 2414.64s]  you oxidize, I mean, you need more oxygen, right?
[2414.64s -> 2417.34s]  So your VO2 increases,
[2417.34s -> 2421.48s]  and then you produce or give up more CO2.
[2422.56s -> 2424.72s]  So this is kind of what it shows.
[2424.72s -> 2428.12s]  When you're in a more like politic state,
[2428.12s -> 2431.24s]  more fatty oxidation state,
[2431.24s -> 2433.56s]  you still consume oxygen,
[2433.56s -> 2437.48s]  but you do not produce as much CO2, right?
[2437.48s -> 2440.58s]  When you are more into a more glycolytic state,
[2440.58s -> 2443.16s]  which is higher exercise intensities,
[2443.16s -> 2447.36s]  when you're recruiting the type two muscle fibers,
[2447.36s -> 2450.78s]  and therefore using more glucose for energy purposes,
[2450.78s -> 2452.64s]  you're going to consume more oxygen
[2452.64s -> 2455.58s]  and you're gonna produce more CO2, right?
[2455.58s -> 2457.66s]  So plug it in all these numbers
[2457.66s -> 2460.44s]  into these stoichiometric equations,
[2460.44s -> 2464.72s]  it's going to give you that profile, right?
[2464.72s -> 2467.92s]  In the X and the Y axis,
[2467.92s -> 2470.22s]  and it's gonna see what is the,
[2470.22s -> 2473.64s]  the fat oxidation throughout a ramp state,
[2473.64s -> 2475.22s]  a ramp test.
[2475.22s -> 2477.14s]  And this is where you're gonna see
[2477.14s -> 2480.42s]  that elite athletes like Bogacar,
[2480.42s -> 2482.84s]  they have an amazing fat oxidation capacity
[2482.84s -> 2487.38s]  compared to other competitive athletes or recreationals,
[2487.38s -> 2492.10s]  or people with even type two diabetes
[2492.10s -> 2493.32s]  or metabolic syndrome,
[2493.32s -> 2497.18s]  or in a recent study we have published with a COVID patient.
[2497.18s -> 2499.84s]  So it reflects in a way,
[2500.22s -> 2504.28s]  ultimately what happens in your mitochondria
[2504.28s -> 2507.16s]  and how the mitochondria oxidizes those fuels
[2507.16s -> 2508.78s]  at different exercise intensity.
[2508.78s -> 2510.54s]  So for example,
[2510.54s -> 2514.60s]  let's say at an intensity of 200,
[2514.60s -> 2516.40s]  let's say 200 Watts,
[2516.40s -> 2521.04s]  like an elite athlete doesn't need to incur
[2521.04s -> 2523.22s]  in that glycolytic capacity
[2523.22s -> 2526.78s]  as much as someone who is not very well trained.
[2526.78s -> 2528.32s]  So the elite athlete,
[2528.32s -> 2530.14s]  they can still recruit,
[2530.22s -> 2532.50s]  slow twitch muscle fibers
[2532.50s -> 2536.42s]  and rely a lot on fat to produce ATP
[2536.42s -> 2539.76s]  because they have an amazing mitochondrial function
[2539.76s -> 2542.78s]  and they're very efficient metabolically speaking.
[2543.66s -> 2546.40s]  Therefore, they're gonna be oxidizing a lot of fat.
[2546.40s -> 2551.40s]  However, someone whose mitochondria are not working as well,
[2552.38s -> 2555.36s]  whether you are like a recreational athlete
[2555.36s -> 2557.04s]  or sedentary individual,
[2557.04s -> 2559.08s]  or someone with type two diabetes,
[2559.08s -> 2562.10s]  which is one of the hallmarks of the disease,
[2562.10s -> 2566.34s]  that mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction at 200 Watts,
[2566.34s -> 2569.00s]  you fully rely on glucose pretty much
[2569.00s -> 2574.00s]  because you cannot sustain that effort with fat alone.
[2575.92s -> 2578.52s]  And this is what you're going to be seeing,
[2578.52s -> 2579.86s]  this gas exchange,
[2579.86s -> 2581.70s]  the CO2 and the VO2,
[2581.70s -> 2584.52s]  you can just plot it into the equation.
[2584.52s -> 2586.32s]  And it's going to give you all that,
[2586.32s -> 2588.42s]  what I call metabolic,
[2588.42s -> 2590.16s]  metabolic map,
[2590.16s -> 2592.18s]  where you see that the fat oxidation,
[2592.18s -> 2593.70s]  that the carbohydrate oxidation,
[2593.70s -> 2596.46s]  and then I plug in also the lactate.
[2596.46s -> 2599.74s]  And that's where everything comes together quite well.
[2599.74s -> 2603.56s]  And you can then first in an indirect way,
[2603.56s -> 2606.66s]  calculate the mitochondrial function
[2606.66s -> 2608.04s]  and metabolic flexibility,
[2608.04s -> 2611.30s]  how flexible they are at using fats or carbohydrates.
[2611.30s -> 2614.88s]  And also you can determine training zones.
[2614.88s -> 2617.32s]  And this is what I've been using this methodology for.
[2617.32s -> 2618.26s]  And this is what I've been using this methodology for.
[2618.26s -> 2619.30s]  And this is what I've been using this methodology for.
[2619.30s -> 2622.52s]  16 years, 17, something like that.
[2622.52s -> 2624.42s]  I didn't think to ask you this earlier,
[2624.42s -> 2626.64s]  but if you have it handy,
[2626.64s -> 2628.98s]  do you want to pull up a graph
[2628.98s -> 2633.40s]  of what fat oxidation looks like versus power
[2633.40s -> 2636.46s]  so that people can see the difference
[2636.46s -> 2639.78s]  between a highly trained individual,
[2639.78s -> 2641.72s]  a reasonably trained individual,
[2641.72s -> 2642.80s]  an untrained individual,
[2642.80s -> 2644.32s]  and at the other end of that spectrum,
[2644.32s -> 2645.58s]  somebody with type two diabetes?
[2645.58s -> 2646.42s]  Sure.
[2646.42s -> 2648.00s]  So let me share a screen then.
[2648.00s -> 2650.16s]  And hopefully this works.
[2650.16s -> 2651.00s]  Okay.
[2651.00s -> 2653.88s]  So this is from a publication
[2653.88s -> 2656.88s]  that my colleague George Brooks and I published in 2017.
[2656.88s -> 2659.22s]  that my colleague George Brooks and I published in 2017.
[2659.22s -> 2661.86s]  So this is the formula.
[2661.86s -> 2664.34s]  And we have realized that this is flipped.
[2664.34s -> 2666.26s]  So we need to send it.
[2666.26s -> 2668.38s]  We're working now with the editor to change it
[2668.38s -> 2672.08s]  because the formula is flipped here in the methods section.
[2672.08s -> 2673.18s]  Which is so funny, by the way.
[2673.18s -> 2674.78s]  I like seeing that.
[2674.78s -> 2677.82s]  I'm embarrassed to say when we do this for our patients,
[2677.82s -> 2681.50s]  we do it in two steps, which yields the same result.
[2681.50s -> 2685.16s]  But we first calculate energy expenditure
[2685.16s -> 2690.16s]  using the Weir coefficients of 3.94 times VO2 minus,
[2690.32s -> 2694.54s]  or one plus one point, I think it's one two times VCO2.
[2694.54s -> 2699.42s]  And then we convert that to fat ox
[2699.42s -> 2704.42s]  and carbohydrate oxidation using the ratio of VCO2 to VO2.
[2705.76s -> 2706.82s]  And I never even thought to do what you've done here.
[2706.82s -> 2707.82s]  And I never even thought to do what you've done here.
[2707.82s -> 2709.58s]  Which is so much more logical,
[2709.58s -> 2712.70s]  which is combine them into a single equation for each.
[2712.70s -> 2717.70s]  Well, we use what Fryen observed already in 1983.
[2717.70s -> 2720.94s]  And this is, it's Fryen's equation.
[2720.94s -> 2723.20s]  And it's been validated with tracers,
[2723.20s -> 2725.74s]  with stable isotope tracers.
[2725.74s -> 2729.02s]  And yeah, and that's what it shows.
[2729.02s -> 2730.40s]  There's a very high correlation.
[2730.40s -> 2735.70s]  Now, furthermore, in study that we were gonna be publishing soon,
[2735.70s -> 2737.20s]  we have validated this,
[2737.82s -> 2739.82s]  we have a very high correlation between fat oxidation
[2739.82s -> 2741.16s]  and carbohydrate oxidation directly
[2741.16s -> 2743.48s]  with mitochondrial respiration.
[2743.48s -> 2745.60s]  So in muscle biopsies,
[2745.60s -> 2750.44s]  we inject directly fatty acids,
[2750.44s -> 2753.36s]  pyruvate representative of carbohydrates, right?
[2753.36s -> 2756.30s]  And glutamine representative of amino acids.
[2756.30s -> 2759.54s]  And then we can see that there's a very high correlation
[2759.54s -> 2762.52s]  between this indirect methodology
[2762.52s -> 2764.22s]  to look at mitochondrial function
[2764.22s -> 2765.54s]  and the direct methodology,
[2765.54s -> 2767.18s]  which is through a muscle biopsy,
[2767.18s -> 2771.06s]  and injecting the substrate and see how it's oxidized, right?
[2771.06s -> 2771.90s]  So-
[2771.90s -> 2774.06s]  So these two graphs are really powerful.
[2774.06s -> 2777.56s]  So let's talk about what the first graph is showing us.
[2777.56s -> 2780.34s]  The first graph is, so both of these graphs,
[2780.34s -> 2783.58s]  it's important to note, have the same X axis.
[2783.58s -> 2786.94s]  In other words, the independent variable here
[2786.94s -> 2789.36s]  is the workload in watts.
[2789.36s -> 2791.50s]  That's the metric that matters in cycling,
[2791.50s -> 2794.30s]  which is, I think, the easiest way to do this test.
[2794.30s -> 2795.88s]  And so you're increasing wattage.
[2795.88s -> 2799.94s]  This is a progressive increase in workload.
[2799.94s -> 2800.78s]  Yes.
[2800.78s -> 2802.42s]  And what you're plotting on the Y axis,
[2802.42s -> 2804.48s]  your dependent variable here,
[2804.48s -> 2808.16s]  in the first graph, figure one, is blood lactate.
[2808.16s -> 2812.60s]  So what stands out to me is a couple of things.
[2812.60s -> 2816.66s]  So you have the triangles represent metabolic syndrome.
[2816.66s -> 2821.46s]  The squares represent kind of a modestly trained athlete,
[2821.46s -> 2822.74s]  and then the little diamonds
[2822.74s -> 2824.48s]  represent a professional athlete.
[2824.48s -> 2824.60s]  Mm-hmm.
[2824.60s -> 2835.12s]  The first thing that stands out to me, and we're going to talk about this later, so I'll put a little pin in this, is that the people with metabolic syndrome have a resting lactate that's almost two millimole.
[2836.38s -> 2836.82s]  Yeah?
[2838.44s -> 2840.32s]  Yes, we see already this.
[2840.56s -> 2847.82s]  And I think that it's going to become more and more as a biomarker, like resting blood glucose levels.
[2848.02s -> 2848.26s]  Yes.
[2848.36s -> 2850.16s]  What is your resting lactate?
[2850.16s -> 2865.12s]  And you can see already in patients with type 2 diabetes or profound metabolic syndrome that, yeah, as you say perfectly, resting levels are in the neighborhood of like a 1.8, 1.5 to even 3.
[2866.02s -> 2866.28s]  Right?
[2866.72s -> 2867.32s]  Yeah.
[2867.62s -> 2877.22s]  So one of the metrics that we've discussed at length, and we'll revisit it, of course, is using this lactate level of about two millimole as being that threshold.
[2877.22s -> 2880.14s]  So once lactate exceeds two millimole.
[2880.70s -> 2886.08s]  The individual is now escaping out of zone two, and they're actually now into zone three.
[2886.28s -> 2895.00s]  So when you look at these data here, you can see that the individual with metabolic syndrome is basically tapping out zone two initially.
[2895.00s -> 2901.26s]  So any incremental workload that is placed on them takes them right out of zone two.
[2901.26s -> 2907.84s]  So they're, for all intents and purposes, by the time they're at a hundred watts, they're already at the threshold of their zone two.
[2908.70s -> 2910.14s]  Now, conversely, when you look at.
[2910.16s -> 2929.80s]  When you look at that sort of medium-trained or reasonably well-trained individual, or what I think it's referred to as moderately active, healthy individuals, you know, they start out with a lactate of about one, and it's not really until they hit about 175 watts that they pass that inflection point.
[2930.80s -> 2939.80s]  And then when you look at the professional athletes, the professional endurance athletes specifically, you know, they're starting out at a lactate level of 0.5.
[2940.16s -> 2952.04s]  Millimole, and they stay relatively flat until they hit about 300 watts is when they finally cross over that threshold.
[2952.72s -> 2961.22s]  Now, what's not captured here is that as you move from left to right, the athletes are getting lighter.
[2962.32s -> 2968.66s]  So this graph, if I'm going to be critical of it, and you go, I would say it should be done in watts per kilo.
[2969.24s -> 2970.04s]  And that would.
[2970.16s -> 2974.20s]  It would show a much starker difference between these.
[2974.30s -> 2980.90s]  And in our patients, when we benchmark them, we benchmark them in watts per kilo for this reason, so that you normalize by weight.
[2982.12s -> 2984.90s]  Yeah, and I'm sorry to interrupt, but you're absolutely right.
[2985.22s -> 2987.42s]  It is that, and that's how we do it also.
[2987.68s -> 2988.24s]  Yes, of course.
[2988.24s -> 2992.78s]  It's just like one of the reviewers didn't allow us to use watts per kilogram.
[2993.98s -> 2995.56s]  So, you know, in the review process.
[2995.56s -> 2997.04s]  That reviewer was an idiot, so that's fine.
[2997.04s -> 3000.04s]  I won't hold it against you because you have an idiot reviewer.
[3000.16s -> 3001.98s]  You know how it is in review papers.
[3002.08s -> 3008.28s]  You want to show something, and eventually it's changed, and it's not exactly the kind of what you want to show, you know,
[3008.32s -> 3010.38s]  because otherwise they don't allow you to publish it.
[3010.52s -> 3010.94s]  But anyways.
[3011.08s -> 3020.08s]  But what's amazing here is that person with metabolic syndrome is probably about one watt per kilo easily, right?
[3020.16s -> 3023.88s]  Or, you know, 1 to 1.3 watts per kilo is their zone 2.
[3023.88s -> 3029.44s]  When you look at the modestly trained individual, they're about 2 watts per kilo.
[3030.16s -> 3030.56s]  Mm-hmm.
[3030.84s -> 3031.20s]  Right?
[3031.36s -> 3035.68s]  They probably weigh maybe 2 to 2.1, 2.2 watts per kilo.
[3036.04s -> 3041.50s]  That professional endurance athlete probably weighs in the neighborhood of 70 kilos.
[3041.74s -> 3042.38s]  Yeah, exactly.
[3042.54s -> 3046.74s]  So, you know, they're in the ballpark of 4 watts per kilo.
[3047.28s -> 3047.70s]  Mm-hmm.
[3048.36s -> 3055.36s]  For our patients, and you go, we typically want, we set the aspiration at 3 watts per kilo.
[3056.22s -> 3058.86s]  So, again, our patients aren't professional athletes.
[3059.06s -> 3059.46s]  Mm-hmm.
[3059.46s -> 3060.08s]  But we think that.
[3060.16s -> 3064.70s]  3 watts per kilo would be kind of the elite level that we would want to see people.
[3065.24s -> 3067.14s]  And then, of course, we stratify from there.
[3067.68s -> 3073.24s]  Okay, let's look at the lower figure, figure 2, just beneath this.
[3073.24s -> 3075.94s]  So, here, we're looking at the same group of individuals.
[3076.32s -> 3080.00s]  We have the same independent variable, which is work.
[3080.42s -> 3085.22s]  But now, we're calculating fat oxidation as a function of that work.
[3085.30s -> 3090.14s]  So, now, your dependent variable is fat oxidation, which, again, very easy to calculate via indirect.
[3090.16s -> 3090.78s]  Calorimetry.
[3091.76s -> 3093.56s]  Two things stand out again.
[3094.20s -> 3101.80s]  The first is the obvious, which is the fitter the individual, the higher their absolute capacity for fat oxidation.
[3102.40s -> 3109.38s]  But something else stands out to me, and you go, and I have now seen this repeatedly across multiple data sets,
[3109.84s -> 3119.14s]  which is a fit individual actually increases fat oxidation to a local maxima before beginning that decline.
[3119.28s -> 3119.70s]  Mm-hmm.
[3119.70s -> 3124.80s]  Whereas most mortals begin at a maximum and decline from there.
[3125.34s -> 3126.68s]  Can you explain why that's happening?
[3127.56s -> 3128.04s]  Yes.
[3128.32s -> 3130.24s]  Yeah, it's something that I agree.
[3130.24s -> 3132.46s]  I see this all the time, right?
[3133.22s -> 3138.18s]  I think that, on one hand, it's how you start a protocol, right?
[3139.62s -> 3141.84s]  In this case, we started like at 1.
[3142.18s -> 3145.26s]  We started about 1 to 1.5 watts per kilogram.
[3145.62s -> 3145.88s]  Mm-hmm.
[3146.84s -> 3149.24s]  And that, obviously, for an elite athlete is…
[3149.70s -> 3150.78s]  Trivial.
[3150.78s -> 3153.54s]  It's a low resting level, so this is why they're very low.
[3154.20s -> 3159.34s]  And they don't need to use much fat for energy purposes until you push them more.
[3159.34s -> 3164.34s]  And that's when you get to like 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 watts per kilogram, right?
[3165.02s -> 3171.56s]  And, again, this protocol comes originally from the work that I've been doing for 20 years,
[3171.64s -> 3173.48s]  this same protocol with elite athletes.
[3173.94s -> 3179.68s]  Now, when you do the same protocol with other populations, especially people with metabolic syndrome or not very fit,
[3179.86s -> 3185.46s]  and you start at 1.5 watts per kilogram, that might be too much, right?
[3185.46s -> 3192.14s]  And I'm sure you have observed that if you start at 0.5 watts per kilogram, you might see a higher fat oxidation,
[3192.78s -> 3195.52s]  and then you might see the same phenomenon.
[3196.20s -> 3198.16s]  So, on one hand, it's that protocol.
[3198.66s -> 3205.04s]  But on the other hand, yeah, sure, like 0.5 watts per kilogram, it's like nothing, you know?
[3205.22s -> 3207.20s]  It's close to resting levels almost.
[3207.44s -> 3209.58s]  So, it will take you for a long time.
[3209.58s -> 3209.62s]  Right.
[3209.62s -> 3209.66s]  Right.
[3209.66s -> 3209.68s]  Right.
[3209.70s -> 3214.06s]  But that being said, I think that one thing that we're doing with populations,
[3214.30s -> 3221.42s]  more clinical populations, is really start at a very low level, even up to 50 watts or 25 watts sometimes, you know?
[3221.54s -> 3227.18s]  So, we can start with this point because if you start at 2 watts per kilogram or 1.5 watts per kilogram
[3227.18s -> 3233.84s]  with someone with a significant metabolic dysregulation, you're going to miss the fat max.
[3234.24s -> 3234.38s]  Yeah.
[3234.70s -> 3235.44s]  I agree.
[3235.58s -> 3238.70s]  We have been struggling to tune our algorithm.
[3239.42s -> 3239.66s]  Exactly.
[3239.66s -> 3255.26s]  To exactly that because I actually think that, and I had this discussion with our team a week ago, which was the physiologists who are doing this with our patients are probably overcooking the people who are not fit during the warmup.
[3255.44s -> 3263.78s]  So, they do a warmup, and the warmup is actually too stressful, and it overcooks them, and then we're missing kind of the true max fat.
[3264.28s -> 3264.42s]  Okay.
[3264.42s -> 3268.74s]  So, the next thing I want to point out here is that the…
[3268.74s -> 3268.78s]  Yeah.
[3268.78s -> 3268.82s]  Yeah.
[3268.82s -> 3268.84s]  Yeah.
[3268.84s -> 3268.86s]  Yeah.
[3268.86s -> 3268.88s]  Yeah.
[3268.88s -> 3268.90s]  Yeah.
[3268.90s -> 3268.92s]  Yeah.
[3268.92s -> 3268.94s]  Yeah.
[3268.94s -> 3268.96s]  Yeah.
[3268.96s -> 3268.98s]  Yeah.
[3268.98s -> 3269.00s]  Yeah.
[3269.00s -> 3269.04s]  Yeah.
[3269.04s -> 3269.06s]  Yeah.
[3269.06s -> 3269.08s]  Yeah.
[3269.08s -> 3269.10s]  Yeah.
[3269.10s -> 3269.12s]  Yeah.
[3269.12s -> 3269.14s]  Yeah.
[3269.14s -> 3269.16s]  Yeah.
[3269.16s -> 3269.20s]  Yeah.
[3269.20s -> 3269.26s]  Yeah.
[3269.26s -> 3269.30s]  Yeah.
[3269.30s -> 3269.36s]  Yeah.
[3269.36s -> 3269.38s]  Yeah.
[3269.66s -> 3270.36s]  Yeah.
[3270.36s -> 3270.42s]  Yeah.
[3270.42s -> 3270.44s]  Yeah.
[3270.44s -> 3270.46s]  Yeah.
[3270.46s -> 3270.48s]  Yeah.
[3270.48s -> 3270.50s]  Yeah.
[3270.50s -> 3270.52s]  Yeah.
[3270.52s -> 3270.54s]  Yeah.
[3270.54s -> 3270.56s]  Yeah.
[3270.84s -> 3270.88s]  Yeah.
[3270.88s -> 3270.90s]  Yeah.
[3270.90s -> 3270.92s]  Yeah.
[3270.92s -> 3270.94s]  Yeah.
[3270.94s -> 3270.96s]  Yeah.
[3270.96s -> 3271.00s]  Yeah.
[3271.00s -> 3271.02s]  Yeah.
[3271.02s -> 3271.04s]  Yeah.
[3271.04s -> 3271.08s]  Yeah.
[3271.08s -> 3271.10s]  Yeah.
[3271.10s -> 3274.78s]  But it's true for all of them, but it's easiest to see here.
[3275.34s -> 3278.78s]  Fat max, so fat max ox, right?
[3278.84s -> 3285.78s]  So, maximum fat oxidation is occurring earlier than lactate is two, and that's true for all
[3285.78s -> 3290.18s]  of them except for the Metsin person because it's so low.
[3290.54s -> 3296.60s]  But if you look at the moderately fit person, they're hitting maximum fat oxidation at about
[3296.60s -> 3299.64s]  130 watts, but they're hitting lactate of two.
[3299.66s -> 3304.60s]  They're hitting lactate of two at 175 watts in the upper figure, and the professional
[3304.60s -> 3314.24s]  athlete is hitting an absolute fat oxidation maxima at a little shy of 250 watts, but they're
[3314.24s -> 3318.22s]  hitting lactate of two closer to 300 watts.
[3319.62s -> 3327.70s]  So, I guess the question then becomes, which one of these do you think ... Well, you've
[3327.70s -> 3329.64s]  already answered part of the question, which is we're really doing a lot of work on the
[3329.64s -> 3335.98s]  refining zone two as the place where maximum fat oxidation occurs, but I guess this would
[3335.98s -> 3342.86s]  suggest that using a lactate level of two is maybe overestimating where that is, and
[3342.86s -> 3349.58s]  should we be using a lower level of lactate such as 1.5 or something like that?
[3350.84s -> 3355.48s]  Yeah, that's an excellent question, and this is what I've been learning all these years
[3355.48s -> 3359.48s]  is that the blood lactate levels ...
[3359.64s -> 3360.64s]  Yeah.
[3360.64s -> 3365.32s]  ... might change between different groups, and it's everything related to the lactate
[3365.32s -> 3371.30s]  kinetics and lactate oxidation in the mitochondria.
[3371.30s -> 3380.40s]  So for example, elite athletes to ... And this was part of my doctorate thesis and some
[3380.40s -> 3387.84s]  of this I never published 20 something years ago, but the same blood lactate concentration
[3387.84s -> 3388.84s]  ... Yeah.
[3388.84s -> 3395.00s]  ... does not correspond to the same ... In an elite athlete, does not correspond necessarily
[3395.00s -> 3402.84s]  to the same lactate concentration in a recreational athlete, the metabolic stress.
[3402.84s -> 3413.54s]  So for example, two millimoles or two millimolar of lactate in these elite athletes might be
[3413.54s -> 3416.84s]  a higher metabolic stress than two millimoles in a metabolic patient.
[3416.84s -> 3417.84s]  Yeah.
[3417.84s -> 3421.46s]  So this is why ... And it would be very difficult.
[3421.46s -> 3427.84s]  For example, you can have, let's say, two and a half millimoles, you can have a metabolic
[3427.84s -> 3433.38s]  syndrome patient exercising for a couple hours without a big deal.
[3433.38s -> 3437.84s]  You try to do that with a professional athlete, and they're going to be hurting, right?
[3437.84s -> 3444.08s]  And in fact, one of the things that I observed is I used four millimole or millimolar, which
[3444.08s -> 3446.84s]  is kind of that gold standard has been forever, like the lactate threshold.
[3446.84s -> 3447.84s]  Yes.
[3447.84s -> 3455.54s]  And if you put a world-class athlete at four millimoles of lactate, at the intensity in
[3455.54s -> 3464.00s]  power output that elicits four millimoles, and you put a recreational athlete at the
[3464.00s -> 3469.68s]  power output that elicits also four millimoles, and you say, now go, right, and see who lasts
[3469.68s -> 3473.46s]  the most, intuitively, we're going to say, obviously, it's going to be the professional
[3473.46s -> 3474.46s]  athlete.
[3474.46s -> 3475.46s]  It's the opposite.
[3475.46s -> 3476.46s]  Yeah.
[3476.46s -> 3477.46s]  That's right.
[3477.46s -> 3483.14s]  I saw 20-something years ago where the recreational athletes at the same blood lactate concentration
[3483.14s -> 3487.78s]  would go about 30% longer period of time.
[3487.78s -> 3491.36s]  And that's because metabolically, it's not as tasking.
[3491.36s -> 3500.78s]  And the main reason is that the lactate that we see in the blood, it reflects the mitochondrial
[3500.78s -> 3501.78s]  oxidation.
[3501.78s -> 3504.46s]  So someone who has...
[3504.46s -> 3506.16s]  Obviously, when we're talking about...
[3506.46s -> 3512.28s]  High power output, when you need a lot of glycolysis to produce energy, you're going
[3512.28s -> 3514.28s]  to produce lactate.
[3514.28s -> 3521.06s]  Lactate is the mandatory, obligatory byproduct, not waste product, but byproduct of glycolysis.
[3521.06s -> 3524.18s]  So the higher the glycolysis, the higher the lactate.
[3524.18s -> 3527.66s]  Now that lactate has two routes, mainly.
[3527.66s -> 3534.74s]  One is going from the fast twitch muscle fibers to the slow twitch muscle fibers, is the lactate
[3534.74s -> 3535.74s]  shuttle.
[3535.74s -> 3537.40s]  That's what George Brooks discovered.
[3537.40s -> 3543.86s]  And it's oxidizing the mitochondria of those slow twitch muscle fibers.
[3543.86s -> 3548.44s]  If you have a very good lactate clearance capacity, you're going to be oxidizing it
[3548.44s -> 3550.62s]  very, very well for fuel.
[3550.62s -> 3555.72s]  Therefore, you're not going to incur in the second step, which is exporting it to the
[3555.72s -> 3557.44s]  blood.
[3557.44s -> 3564.08s]  When you have a poor mitochondrial function, it's going to get to a point that that capacity
[3564.08s -> 3565.74s]  is going to get saturated.
[3565.74s -> 3572.18s]  At a lower power output, and therefore, you're going to be forced to export that to the blood.
[3572.18s -> 3576.24s]  So that's why looking at blood lactates might not mean the same.
[3576.24s -> 3579.56s]  I'm not saying that these parties are huge by no means, right?
[3579.56s -> 3584.54s]  But as you very well said, those two millimoles might not correspond in an elite athlete with
[3584.54s -> 3588.64s]  a fat max, but might be more maybe towards 1.5.
[3588.64s -> 3593.44s]  Whereas maybe in someone with a more recreational or metabolic syndrome, it might correspond
[3593.44s -> 3594.44s]  there.
[3594.44s -> 3595.44s]  I don't know.
[3595.44s -> 3596.14s]  Does that make sense?
[3596.14s -> 3597.32s]  No, it completely makes sense.
[3597.32s -> 3601.80s]  And this is definitely the level of nuance that I don't think we captured in the first
[3601.80s -> 3602.80s]  podcast.
[3602.80s -> 3609.48s]  And I want to now ask a more telling question specifically for the middle person here.
[3609.48s -> 3614.44s]  So the one that's called the moderately active individual, where again, we have a disparity,
[3614.44s -> 3615.44s]  right?
[3615.44s -> 3621.00s]  So based on these data, the moderately fit individual hits a lactate of two millimole
[3621.00s -> 3624.08s]  at 175 watts.
[3624.08s -> 3625.34s]  But hits a max fat mass.
[3625.34s -> 3630.28s]  Hits a max fat oxidation at, gosh, 125 watts.
[3630.28s -> 3632.80s]  So it's a 50 watt difference.
[3632.80s -> 3638.34s]  So now the question for you is, when that person comes to you and says, Inigo, I want
[3638.34s -> 3645.12s]  to improve my metabolic function, I want to improve my mitochondrial performance, I want
[3645.12s -> 3650.74s]  to improve my fuel partitioning, my flexibility, all the things we talk about, are you going
[3650.74s -> 3654.34s]  to train them as a zone two of 125 watts?
[3654.34s -> 3655.34s]  Or are you going to train them as a zone two of 125 watts?
[3655.34s -> 3660.72s]  Or as a zone two of 175 watts, as represented by these deltas?
[3660.72s -> 3661.84s]  That's a very good question.
[3661.84s -> 3669.58s]  And normally, I would try to do something in the middle normally, and again, this, yeah,
[3669.58s -> 3675.96s]  it might not coincide perfectly, but normally they do quite well.
[3675.96s -> 3680.96s]  And another parameter that if you allow me, I can show you in this paper, this is what
[3680.96s -> 3684.28s]  when decided, we see individually, right?
[3684.28s -> 3685.34s]  The lactate.
[3685.34s -> 3686.34s]  Yes.
[3686.34s -> 3687.34s]  And then we see the fat oxidation.
[3687.34s -> 3691.82s]  But they were, I decided to cross them over, right?
[3691.82s -> 3697.02s]  And this is what we saw in this graph over here.
[3697.02s -> 3698.84s]  So this is, can you see it okay?
[3698.84s -> 3699.84s]  Yes.
[3699.84s -> 3704.94s]  So this is where you see that the lactate versus, I mean, sorry, the lactate versus
[3704.94s -> 3709.90s]  the fat oxidation, right, in the elite athlete.
[3709.90s -> 3712.34s]  And the R is 0.97.
[3712.34s -> 3714.34s]  This is true.
[3714.34s -> 3715.34s]  Bonferroni equation.
[3715.34s -> 3718.96s]  So this is an average, right, of all of them.
[3718.96s -> 3726.34s]  And this is where you see the same pattern, the same graph, for the moderately active.
[3726.34s -> 3730.76s]  And this is also what you see in the people, person with metabolic syndrome.
[3730.76s -> 3732.86s]  The correlations are very, very strong.
[3732.86s -> 3734.54s]  They're almost perfect, right?
[3734.54s -> 3741.24s]  So this is what normally fat oxidation and lactate, they go together, right?
[3741.24s -> 3743.84s]  So for people who are going to be listening to this, Inigo, and not able to see what they're doing,
[3743.84s -> 3744.34s]  right?
[3744.34s -> 3747.10s]  They're not able to see what we're seeing.
[3747.10s -> 3751.00s]  Can you describe the differences between these graphs?
[3751.00s -> 3756.70s]  These are obviously showing the same data that we discussed earlier, but now we're using
[3756.70s -> 3758.18s]  two Y axes.
[3758.18s -> 3761.24s]  So let's even just talk about it as looking at the elite athletes.
[3761.24s -> 3768.44s]  So you're basically plotting the decline in fat oxidation, or in their case, the initial
[3768.44s -> 3773.34s]  increase in fat oxidation, followed by a decline in fat oxidation, and on the same graph, you're
[3773.34s -> 3773.96s]  showing the increase in fat oxidation.
[3773.96s -> 3781.02s]  The increase in lactate production, again, both plotted to the same X axis of power.
[3781.02s -> 3785.26s]  Does the cross point here indicate any significance?
[3785.26s -> 3788.46s]  So they're crossing at about 325 watts.
[3788.46s -> 3790.46s]  Is there anything about that that means anything?
[3790.46s -> 3796.16s]  I mean, to me, I think it's an artifact of the graph because it's really just a function of how you scale it, correct?
[3796.16s -> 3796.66s]  Yes.
[3796.66s -> 3797.66s]  Yeah, exactly.
[3797.66s -> 3803.60s]  I mean, it shows to me that, yeah, the crossover point for blood lactate and fat oxidation.
[3803.60s -> 3803.86s]  Yeah, exactly. I mean, it shows to me that, yeah, the crossover point for blood lactate and fat oxidation.
[3803.96s -> 3809.42s]  It's very high, obviously, in the elite athletes, very far to the right.
[3809.42s -> 3809.92s]  Right.
[3809.92s -> 3816.42s]  And then, of course, in the moderately fit people, it looks like it's closer to 180 watts.
[3816.42s -> 3817.20s]  Exactly.
[3817.20s -> 3820.56s]  And in the unfit individual, it's about 125 watts.
[3820.56s -> 3822.22s]  In a person with metabolic syndrome.
[3822.22s -> 3822.72s]  Yeah.
[3822.72s -> 3833.96s]  And again, I mean, if you started, and I'm sure you have seen this, but if you started with a metabolic syndrome, for example, at 25 watts, you might see, or even in the
[3833.96s -> 3840.28s]  even earlier you might see a similar pattern as you would see in the elite athlete but a much
[3840.28s -> 3846.54s]  lower watts obviously it is that um we just did the same protocol for everybody uh just to show
[3846.54s -> 3855.82s]  the concept right um that um you know both fat oxidation and lactate go together and also when
[3855.82s -> 3861.20s]  we look into and i'm sorry i should have gone this to this directly when we look into fat oxidation
[3861.20s -> 3867.48s]  and carbohydrate oxidation we see the same concept right so we see as exercise intensity increases
[3867.48s -> 3874.46s]  you need to oxidize more carbohydrates um and then as exercise intensity increases you might
[3874.46s -> 3881.50s]  get to the fat max and then in a moment you switch to the glycolytic fibers uh you cannot use much
[3881.50s -> 3888.64s]  fat for energy purposes so you see a sharp decline and eventually fat oxidation disappears
[3888.64s -> 3890.88s]  and it's all full glycolytic
[3891.20s -> 3897.18s]  and the same pattern we see in the rest of populations with also very high um statistical
[3897.18s -> 3903.66s]  significances and correlations um so that's where like all these elements fat oxidation
[3903.66s -> 3909.10s]  carbohydrates and lactate they're very well connected um if we look in the other graph
[3909.10s -> 3915.96s]  this is the correlation between lactate and carbohydrates right we see that overall the
[3915.96s -> 3920.54s]  correlations are quite good because yeah lactate is the byproduct of
[3920.54s -> 3921.18s]  of
[3921.18s -> 3928.70s]  of glucose utilization right you may see that in the elite athletes though the gap is wider here
[3928.70s -> 3933.08s]  and this is for the same reason that we're seeing earlier they use a lot of glucose they're using so
[3933.08s -> 3938.28s]  much of they're using so much fat there as well is really the point right so the bigger the gap
[3938.28s -> 3943.28s]  between the blood lactate curve and the carbohydrate oxidation curve the more efficient
[3943.28s -> 3950.94s]  the individual is the more they're able to oxidize fatty acid then they have to require glucose and
[3950.94s -> 3951.16s]  clearly the more they're able to oxidize fatty acid the more they're able to oxidize fatty acid
[3951.16s -> 3961.18s]  lactate because uh again the mandatory byproduct of glucose oxidation is uh lactate so here the
[3961.18s -> 3966.94s]  lactate doesn't show up in the blood yeah that's interesting it's it's it's it's hard to disentangle
[3966.94s -> 3973.86s]  those two because you mentioned a good point that i omitted this in part reflects the lactate shuttle
[3973.86s -> 3981.04s]  this in part reflects the ability for them to reuse lactate as a fuel as opposed
[3981.16s -> 3988.82s]  to just letting it get out there with hydrogen and start to poison sarcomeres so let let me see
[3988.82s -> 3994.48s]  the the other slide that you you wanted to show that explains i think how the mct transporters
[3994.48s -> 4000.92s]  work yeah so this is a little bit more of the the bioenergetics of the cells of the main two
[4000.92s -> 4008.14s]  substrates which are fatty acids and lactate i mean and pyruvate and also lactate right
[4008.14s -> 4010.84s]  so normally glucose goes through glycolysis and
[4010.84s -> 4011.14s]  and
[4011.16s -> 4015.78s]  and this is this is the cytosol this is the outside of the mitochondria the inside of the cell
[4015.78s -> 4023.46s]  and glucose once it's what it enters the glue the cell it's uh oxidized to pyruvate that pyruvate
[4023.46s -> 4030.40s]  needs to enter the mitochondria through what's called the mitochondrion pyruvate carrier and
[4030.40s -> 4036.60s]  it's oxidized to acetyl-coa which enters the krebs cycle right this is a complete oxidation of
[4036.60s -> 4041.12s]  glucose through oxidative phosphorylation in the krebs cycle and electron
[4041.16s -> 4048.92s]  transport chain then fatty acids have the same mechanisms to i mean i mean they also get
[4048.92s -> 4054.36s]  converted to acetyl-coa but through different mechanisms fatty acids are transporter through
[4054.36s -> 4061.24s]  cpt1 and then cpt2 go through beta oxidation acetyl-coa and enter the cell right but every
[4061.24s -> 4068.12s]  time that you use glucose you produce pyruvate and every single time that pyruvate is going to
[4068.12s -> 4068.60s]  be reduced to lactate always right so if you have a low acidity acid that is going to be reduced to
[4068.60s -> 4069.30s]  lactate at least once every time that you use glucose you're going to get that cyto-acidic acid
[4069.30s -> 4069.82s]  so at this point you're gonna get more acidity in the cell because the in the cell is going to be
[4069.82s -> 4070.28s]  when you're on the hierarchy and you were that's the main some I think the most common thing that guys
[4070.28s -> 4070.72s]  and i think that's the main thing that the most common thing that guys and ladies and ladies have
[4070.72s -> 4091.42s]  And this is the key concept. So when you have a constant glycolytic flux, you're going to, in one of the steps of glycolysis, you're going to utilize NAD, and it's going to be transformed to NADH plus hydrogen.
[4091.42s -> 4112.54s]  So if you use this mechanism a lot, you're going to replenish NAD. I mean, you're going to deplete NAD. The only way that rescues NAD is the reduction of pyruvate to lactate, which replenishes NAD going back for glycolysis, and this is absolutely necessary for the continuation of glycolysis.
[4112.82s -> 4121.40s]  But anyways, and this was an aside note, but this lactate enters the cell, right, through a specific, I mean, the mitochondria through a specific.
[4121.42s -> 4140.70s]  transporter, MCT1, and has a specific enzyme, LDAs, that oxidize lactate back to pyruvate and going back to the Krebs cycle. So again, this is an extra fuel. But for that, you need to have these transporters very well developed.
[4140.88s -> 4151.40s]  Yeah, let me try to explain this to people who aren't able to see the graph, because this is such an important point, right? So you're showing a picture of the mitochondria.
[4151.42s -> 4180.68s]  And we're looking at the outer mitochondrial membrane. We're talking about three transporters, three things that let substrates from the outside to the inside, where they will undergo the most efficient form of ATP production. So the first is we have the fatty acids. They enter directly, and they undergo an oxidation where they get truncated into little two carbon chains, and they enter the Krebs cycle. We get that one, and we know why that one's very good.
[4181.42s -> 4205.14s]  What I think is very interesting here is when you contrast the two different fates of glucose byproducts. So the traditional way that we think about this, glucose being reduced to pyruvate, pyruvate directly entering the cell through its own carrier, and then being converted to acetyl-CoA, which follows the same fate as the fatty acid.
[4205.76s -> 4211.14s]  Now, when energy demand increases, and we just looked at graph after graph that demonstrates that,
[4211.42s -> 4241.40s]  no matter how fit you are at some point, you have to produce more lactate. So you now don't have sufficient cellular oxygen to go down that first route. So you start making lactate. But if you have enough MCT1 transporters on the outer mitochondrial membrane, you can now bring that lactate in the cell and actually do the reverse of what just happened. Turn that lactate back into pyruvate. Pyruvate becomes acetyl-CoA.
[4241.42s -> 4253.00s]  And everybody wins the game again. The game being won, of course, because now you're making 32 units of ATP instead of just the two units you would make converting pyruvate to lactate.
[4253.00s -> 4271.00s]  So it begs a very important question, which is earlier when you spoke about what makes Pogacar so remarkable physiologically, one of those things is he must have a boatload of MCT1 transporters on his outer mitochondrial membrane.
[4271.42s -> 4285.86s]  And that must explain in part why his lactate levels are so much lower than everybody else's at a comparable work level. How much of that is genetic? And how much of that is the result of his training?
[4286.50s -> 4299.78s]  Exactly. So you're right. He has a much higher level to oxidize lactate, right? So there's a genetic component, no doubt about it. But there's also an epigenetic component, right?
[4299.78s -> 4299.86s]  Right.
[4301.42s -> 4327.34s]  Right. The genes are not your fate, necessarily, right? From the genes to be able to be transcribed and, you know, and form a protein with biological action, the probability is less than 20%. That's kind of what the science is showing, roughly, right?
[4327.34s -> 4331.34s]  This is the whole from genetics to genetics.
[4331.42s -> 4358.62s]  Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, right? It's about 20% chances that one gene is going to be ultimately expressed. Obviously, we're still trying to understand all this. So these elite athletes, probably they have a much higher possibilities, right? But there's a long journey. And this is where epigenetics occur, right? It's like what you eat, how you rest, how you train. And I think that the training is also an important component of this.
[4359.30s -> 4359.94s]  Right.
[4359.94s -> 4361.38s]  This is, for example, why we train.
[4361.42s -> 4391.28s]  We train very, very specifically this energy system. And we try to dial in as much as we can specifically to try to stimulate this bioenergetics system and increase the MCT1s, the transporters for lactate, as well as all the components in the Krebs cycle, right? Which is the mitochondrial respiration. And also to increase also the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, because as we might discuss later, this is already dysregulated in people.
[4391.42s -> 4400.42s]  Or downregulated in people who are sedentary, right? But the thing is, like, if you see this next slide, can you see it? Okay?
[4400.72s -> 4401.04s]  Yes.
[4401.04s -> 4420.18s]  So this is what, you know, makes the difference in these athletes, right? So this is a fast-twitch muscle fiber, and they use glucose. So this is when you're like a high exercise intensity, it's climbing or running at a high intensity, or swimming or whatever the activity you do, you need glucose.
[4421.42s -> 4433.24s]  Glucose is, as you said very well, it yields less ATP, but it does it much faster, right? Than the diesel gasoline, which is the fat.
[4433.40s -> 4446.66s]  So, but when you use glucose, you're always going to produce pyruvate. So that pyruvate, you know, the higher the intensity, the more glucose you need, the more pyruvate you will need, and the more lactate that you will produce.
[4447.14s -> 4451.24s]  So that lactate has, as I said earlier, two reasons.
[4451.42s -> 4471.80s]  Two routes. One route is like, it's exported through the MCT force, which is the transport of lactate outside the fast-twitch muscle fibers. Something that also is trainable, right? The capacity to export lactate through high-intensity exercise. And then it travels to the adjacent slow-twitch muscle fibers.
[4472.54s -> 4479.30s]  And if we blow up this mitochondria in the slow-twitch muscle fibers, this is what will happen.
[4479.30s -> 4481.36s]  The entrance of that lactate.
[4481.42s -> 4487.60s]  It goes through another transporters, MCT1, it's the same family, but instead of four, it's called MCT1.
[4488.02s -> 4494.62s]  And as I mentioned earlier, that lactate is converted to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA and goes into the Krebs cycle.
[4495.04s -> 4505.30s]  So in these well-trained athletes like Pogacar, for example, they have an amazing ability to oxidize the lactate inside mitochondria, right?
[4505.78s -> 4511.26s]  At some point, every single human gets to a point that they cannot sustain the effort.
[4511.42s -> 4523.54s]  But what makes the difference is that these guys can do 400 watts for a long time versus a mere mortal who can not even do two strokes at 400 watts, right?
[4523.54s -> 4535.10s]  So what happens is like when you don't have the right MCT1 and mitochondrial function, this lactate is going to increase and accumulate, right?
[4535.10s -> 4540.92s]  And it's not lactate per se, but the hydrogen ions associated to lactate elicit an acid.
[4542.14s -> 4551.40s]  Acidosis of the microenvironment of the muscle, which is something that we know and we have learned also from cancer, the famous cancer microenvironment, which is very acidic.
[4551.88s -> 4562.32s]  And that's going to interfere with different functions in the muscle with both the contractual force and the velocity of the muscle fibers.
[4563.04s -> 4570.26s]  I'm not saying that this is the cause of fatigue by no means, because there are multiple theories and we still try to understand the central fatigue as well.
[4570.34s -> 4571.32s]  And everything probably is interrelated.
[4571.42s -> 4573.04s]  Or it must be interrelated.
[4573.40s -> 4578.74s]  But the bottom line is like when this lactate cannot be oxidized, it is exported to the blood.
[4579.66s -> 4592.42s]  And this is why you see that people with metabolic syndrome, for example, or type two diabetes who are characterized by having a very poor mitochondrial function, they cannot do an exercise, oxidize this lactate.
[4592.54s -> 4599.84s]  In the moment they start using glucose, which is very fast also because they don't have the fast twitch, the slow twitch muscle fibers, mitochondria to use fat.
[4600.22s -> 4601.14s]  They need to rely on glucose.
[4601.14s -> 4607.38s]  That's that metabolic reprogramming or partitioning they have, they produce lactate, but they cannot oxidize the lactate.
[4607.74s -> 4615.66s]  That's why this lactate chooses mandatorily the route of being exported to the blood and in the blood, then it goes to any tissue in the body.
[4616.20s -> 4621.00s]  So this is what I meant earlier about what is two millimoles versus one millimole.
[4621.54s -> 4626.70s]  Whereas Pogacar, for example, he oxidizes a lot of this lactate.
[4627.12s -> 4630.42s]  So by the time that Pogacar saturates this transporter.
[4630.42s -> 4640.68s]  And this mitochondrial capacity to oxidize lactate, it's a tremendous amount of power output and a tremendous amount of glucose that he puts out.
[4641.10s -> 4655.14s]  So this is why that the one millimole or 1.5 millimole in a world-class athlete doesn't necessarily represent the same metabolic status of a 1.5 or 2 millimoles in the blood of a normal person.
[4655.46s -> 4656.18s]  Does it make sense?
[4656.84s -> 4658.10s]  It makes complete sense.
[4658.10s -> 4660.42s]  This is a fantastic tutorial.
[4660.70s -> 4661.90s]  In muscle physiology.
[4662.66s -> 4675.38s]  And again, this very important distinction between lactate production at the local level and lactate that we measure at the global level.
[4675.92s -> 4677.20s]  That's the challenge we have.
[4677.26s -> 4683.18s]  When we are measuring lactate, we cannot impute lactate clearance and lactate production.
[4683.56s -> 4686.02s]  We can only impute the sum of those.
[4686.54s -> 4686.94s]  Exactly.
[4686.94s -> 4690.40s]  And we think, I mean, it's originally thought, right?
[4690.50s -> 4693.80s]  That these athletes, they don't use as much glucose, right?
[4693.88s -> 4699.64s]  Well, in fact, the Richard shows and Brooks and his team showed it that and others do that.
[4700.04s -> 4704.10s]  The well-trained athletes, in fact, they use more glucose because they have to.
[4704.56s -> 4709.50s]  You cannot do 400 watts with that massive amount of carbohydrate oxidation.
[4709.86s -> 4716.68s]  And this is what we also see in the indirect calorimetry that, you know, you see people, recreationals for people with metabolic syndrome.
[4716.88s -> 4720.38s]  They have like four grams per minute at max.
[4720.48s -> 4726.14s]  Carbohydrate oxidation, whereas elite athletes, they can get to six and a half grams per minute.
[4726.14s -> 4730.52s]  It's a massive amount of glucose and they produce a lot more lactate.
[4731.14s -> 4735.94s]  But the key is like it doesn't show up in the blood.
[4735.94s -> 4740.56s]  It's the rate of appearance in the blood because it's oxidized in the muscle.
[4740.74s -> 4742.30s]  So it doesn't show up in the blood.
[4742.30s -> 4749.94s]  It's the balance of lactate production and lactate oxidation without getting to the blood.
[4750.42s -> 4758.62s]  And this is what it correlates a lot also with with the fat oxidation as well and the graphs that I was showing earlier.
[4759.32s -> 4767.94s]  So one of the things I want to ask you about here that is a bit of a confounder when we do this type of analysis is the carbohydrate content within the diet.
[4768.52s -> 4778.04s]  So I'll share with you my data, but I've now seen this with multiple people, including one individual who's remarkably fit.
[4779.64s -> 4780.04s]  So.
[4780.42s -> 4781.90s]  God, it's how many years now?
[4781.96s -> 4784.80s]  Ten years ago, I was on a ketogenic diet for three years.
[4785.40s -> 4792.92s]  And part of that three year window overlapped with the very end of that three year period was when I kind of got back into cycling.
[4795.36s -> 4800.60s]  So at my fittest as a adult cyclist, I was back eating a lot of carbohydrates.
[4800.80s -> 4810.40s]  But there was about a six to 12 month period when I was still in ketosis and I was kind of getting back into cycling.
[4810.44s -> 4820.72s]  And I do have one VO2 max test from that window of time, probably six months after getting back to cycling and still on ketosis.
[4821.22s -> 4824.44s]  I've gone back and looked at the data and they're very interesting.
[4824.88s -> 4832.16s]  So what I would observe is maximum fat oxidation was 1.3 grams per minute.
[4832.16s -> 4835.66s]  And that occurred almost immediately.
[4835.66s -> 4840.16s]  And it's sustained until I hit.
[4840.42s -> 4857.88s]  My, well, let me think I, it was sustained until about, so at the time my FTP was about 4.1 Watts per kilo, this would have been sustained until about 3.5 Watts per kilo.
[4858.72s -> 4864.60s]  So at 3.5 Watts per kilo, I was still oxidizing about 1.2 grams per minute.
[4865.02s -> 4869.64s]  And then that sort of fell off and glucose become.
[4869.64s -> 4870.20s]  Became.
[4870.20s -> 4885.90s]  Became then the dominant fuel source at the, at the, at the completion of the test, when I was done, you know, when I failed, I was obviously not oxidizing any fat, um, and glucose oxidation was just under six grams per minute.
[4886.90s -> 4891.94s]  Uh, yeah, about six grams per minute, about 24 Kcal per minute.
[4893.28s -> 4900.14s]  So, um, I've also seen this with another athlete who's been in ketosis.
[4900.20s -> 4904.26s]  For seven years, uh, is a very fit cyclist.
[4904.26s -> 4905.90s]  Actually, he just sent me his data.
[4906.68s -> 4910.22s]  Um, and it's, it's comparable, right?
[4910.22s -> 4912.92s]  So he's, in fact, he's much fitter than I was.
[4912.92s -> 4918.64s]  So his FTP, his 20 minute FTP test is about 412 Watts for 20 minutes.
[4919.04s -> 4923.66s]  Um, and surprisingly he has decent glycolytic power.
[4923.70s -> 4928.52s]  So that's the other thing is I never really had good power at the low end because I only cared about time trialing.
[4928.52s -> 4930.18s]  So it didn't not, it didn't matter.
[4930.20s -> 4933.44s]  How much I could hold, how many Watts I could hold for two minutes or three minutes.
[4933.44s -> 4943.10s]  I only cared about one hour, but you know, this guy could still hold, you know, 1200 Watts for 15 seconds, even for three minutes.
[4943.10s -> 4946.04s]  He's north of 500 Watts, 600 Watts.
[4946.52s -> 4952.52s]  Um, and again, fat oxidation is well, is, you know, one 1.5 grams per minute.
[4953.84s -> 4959.96s]  So it becomes a bit confusing because it would be very difficult to.
[4960.20s -> 4963.44s]  Define zone two by maximum fat oxidation.
[4963.58s -> 4974.36s]  So ketosis is an extreme example, but given how much our Q respiratory quotient, the ratio of VCO two to VO two depends on baseline carbohydrate intake.
[4975.14s -> 4987.86s]  How do we make the adjustment so that we understand, and we're not being misled because if you just looked at my data, you would dramatically overestimate my mitochondrial efficiency.
[4988.22s -> 4988.70s]  Mm-hmm.
[4989.30s -> 4990.18s]  W is, is, is that.
[4990.20s -> 4996.40s]  At a situation where you say, well, actually the lactate might be the more, and unfortunately I don't have lactate data from that test.
[4996.44s -> 5007.32s]  So I can't tell you what my lactate levels were doing, but, um, again, there might not be a problem in the Peloton because you're not going to be in ketosis if you're trying to win the tour de France.
[5007.64s -> 5016.48s]  But, uh, we do see a great degree of carbohydrate and fat variation in the diet amongst people that we're trying to test.
[5016.50s -> 5018.12s]  So how, how do you make that correction?
[5018.38s -> 5018.82s]  Yes.
[5018.98s -> 5020.12s]  So I, I, uh, I'm.
[5020.20s -> 5029.08s]  My humble opinion, uh, what we see in these cases, cuz I see them all the time too, is that there's an artifact in the, uh, metabolic heart.
[5029.68s -> 5042.78s]  Um, the metabolic heart measures, uh, gas exchange, and, and then through the equations, it, it, it kind of says, okay, this gotta be, or this person must be burning fat or burning carbohydrates.
[5042.78s -> 5043.14s]  Right.
[5043.58s -> 5043.98s]  Um,
[5044.14s -> 5045.74s]  uh, but it was calibrated.
[5045.76s -> 5049.68s]  The, the equations are calibrated on high carb diets, presumably.
[5049.94s -> 5050.20s]  Yeah.
[5050.30s -> 5059.04s]  And so the thing is like, as you exercise, no matter what fuel you're using, you, you, you keep increasing oxygen consumption, right?
[5059.64s -> 5063.92s]  But if you don't have much carbohydrates, you're not gonna produce much CO2.
[5064.82s -> 5079.98s]  So that's going to, uh, tweak, you know, uh, um, um, or mislead that, uh, um, stoichiometric equation because the, uh, the, the algorithm is going to think that, oh, whoa, he's using a lot of oxygen.
[5079.98s -> 5081.66s]  And not producing enough CO2.
[5081.88s -> 5084.00s]  So he's gotta be burning a lot of fat.
[5084.84s -> 5088.20s]  That's when you see fats in north of one gram per, per minute.
[5088.30s -> 5088.62s]  Right.
[5088.96s -> 5092.64s]  So th those are fat oxidation that it, I think they're an artifact.
[5093.24s -> 5105.10s]  And I see these because three days later, you know, when you change the diet of that person, uh, three days later, uh, that person's fat oxidation might be 0.35, right?
[5105.10s -> 5109.76s]  So there's no way that the mitochondria adjusts, you know, first, like it reflects.
[5109.76s -> 5123.36s]  It's a very high fat oxidation capacity in someone who we know very well, who is not an elite athlete, whose matter kind of function is not incredibly high to be able to oxidize so much, uh, fat, right.
[5123.36s -> 5127.46s]  And in three days, um, uh, reduces like by three or four times.
[5127.58s -> 5127.94s]  Right.
[5128.24s -> 5139.04s]  So I, I, I attribute this to an artifact of the gas exchange, and this is where, uh, um, uh, looking at lactate, uh, it should give you those parameters.
[5139.10s -> 5139.74s]  You know?
[5139.74s -> 5148.84s]  You normally, what I see in this, in these individuals is that you see maximum lactates of two, three millimoles, right?
[5148.84s -> 5151.02s]  Because simply they don't have carbohydrates.
[5151.50s -> 5161.24s]  Um, also the thing where you see that, yeah, my maximum grams per minute of, of, of carbohydrates was in the six, but you're in ketosis, right?
[5161.24s -> 5167.86s]  So how can you have enough glycogen or glycolytic capacity to elicit such a high carbohydrate production?
[5168.08s -> 5169.44s]  Well, I mean, I think even when you're in.
[5169.44s -> 5177.06s]  In ketosis, you know, you're, you still remember my blood glucose is still, you know, four to five millimole, right?
[5177.06s -> 5194.64s]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, uh, so, so, uh, I would really like to see this studied because again, even if you're only eating 50 grams of glucose a day, think of how much glycogen you're making from all the glycerol from all the fat that's being converted to ketones.
[5194.64s -> 5199.12s]  So, I mean, I think Jeff Volek and Steve Finney have looked at this and.
[5199.44s -> 5211.84s]  When they put people into very, very strict ketosis, but do muscle biopsies, they're still seeing 60% of the glycogen content in the muscle that was there under high carb conditions.
[5212.40s -> 5212.66s]  Yeah.
[5213.18s -> 5219.82s]  So I, I mean, I think my capacity to oxidize five and a half to six grams of glucose per minute was still there.
[5220.32s -> 5224.94s]  Um, it just wasn't, you know, it just took a long time to get there, I think is the difference.
[5224.94s -> 5227.78s]  Um, so I guess the question is.
[5227.94s -> 5228.34s]  Yeah.
[5228.34s -> 5228.36s]  Yeah.
[5228.36s -> 5228.42s]  Yeah.
[5228.42s -> 5228.44s]  Yeah.
[5228.44s -> 5228.50s]  Yeah.
[5228.50s -> 5228.52s]  Yeah.
[5228.52s -> 5228.54s]  Yeah.
[5228.54s -> 5228.56s]  Yeah.
[5228.56s -> 5228.58s]  Yeah.
[5228.58s -> 5228.60s]  Yeah.
[5228.60s -> 5228.66s]  Yeah.
[5228.66s -> 5228.68s]  Yeah.
[5228.68s -> 5228.74s]  Yeah.
[5228.74s -> 5228.76s]  Yeah.
[5228.76s -> 5228.78s]  Yeah.
[5228.78s -> 5228.82s]  Yeah.
[5228.82s -> 5228.84s]  Yeah.
[5228.84s -> 5228.86s]  Yeah.
[5228.86s -> 5228.90s]  Yeah.
[5228.90s -> 5229.38s]  Yeah.
[5229.44s -> 5233.94s]  So the VO2 estimation is off because of the stoichiometric coefficients.
[5234.40s -> 5237.22s]  Do you think the VO2 estimation is off also?
[5237.56s -> 5238.34s]  I don't know.
[5238.42s -> 5243.58s]  I don't think so because, you know, I just hit very well, you know, like other, you know,
[5243.58s -> 5246.02s]  like ketones are used for energy purposes.
[5246.74s -> 5251.74s]  And then we have a third element, which is absolutely key in bioenergetics, which is
[5251.74s -> 5252.14s]  glutamine.
[5253.20s -> 5253.40s]  Right.
[5253.62s -> 5254.74s]  Uh, glutaminolysis.
[5255.04s -> 5256.96s]  It's highly expressed and utilized.
[5257.16s -> 5259.38s]  We have learned that from ICU patients.
[5259.44s -> 5266.56s]  patients. ICU patients is a great model to study metabolism, or stress metabolism. ICU patients,
[5266.56s -> 5275.58s]  they utilized for wound healing about three times more glucose at rest than what we have,
[5275.58s -> 5281.46s]  right? And it's part of the healing process. Glucose is instrumental for cell proliferation,
[5281.46s -> 5289.02s]  wound healing, and part of it is lactate too, as a byproduct in single molecule. But we see
[5289.02s -> 5294.06s]  that, and this is a study that we published, looking indirectly at methodology to look at
[5294.06s -> 5301.56s]  glycogen. It's a pilot study we did with ICU patients. They don't have glycogen. And it makes
[5301.56s -> 5306.60s]  all the sense in the world, because if you enter ICU, first of all, normally-
[5306.60s -> 5311.58s]  Sorry, when you say they don't have glycogen, you mean liver glycogen,
[5311.58s -> 5315.72s]  muscle glycogen are depleted by how much? And depleted to what level?
[5315.72s -> 5318.92s]  Yeah. So let's say that you have 500
[5318.92s -> 5318.94s]  ... Yeah. So let's say that you have 500
[5318.94s -> 5319.00s]  ... Yeah. So let's say that you have 500
[5319.00s -> 5326.92s]  grams of glycogen if you have a full high-carbohydrate diet. So that might not be the
[5326.92s -> 5331.72s]  case of someone entering the ICU. First, because they might not be elite athletes, or they might
[5331.72s -> 5337.24s]  have maybe 300 grams, or they might not have that adaptation to whole more glycogen. So let's say
[5337.24s -> 5343.64s]  they have 300 grams or so. And then by the time they get into that condition,
[5344.20s -> 5348.92s]  the body uses about three times the glucose at rest. Now, an athlete
[5348.92s -> 5357.48s]  uses that same glucose, but at higher intensities, but only for a reduced amount of time, two hours,
[5357.48s -> 5365.16s]  three hours, four hours, whereas the ICU patient is 24-7, right? So eventually, the body is going
[5365.16s -> 5371.24s]  to run out of glycogen in the muscle, or it's going to be under huge stress. So the body has
[5371.24s -> 5377.56s]  evolutionary mechanisms. This is a wonderful machine, and it needs to continue. So it increases
[5377.56s -> 5385.00s]  another route, which is glutaminolysis. So glutamine is an excellent source of fuel.
[5385.00s -> 5392.20s]  It enters directly the mitochondria. We have seen in the publication that we're going to show now
[5392.20s -> 5401.32s]  that when we publish it, is that when we inject mitochondria with glutamate, it's incredibly
[5401.32s -> 5407.40s]  well oxidized. And what's the source of glutamate in these ICU patients? Are they breaking down
[5407.40s -> 5414.28s]  muscle? Exactly. So this is where cachexia comes into place. We know that pretty much every single
[5414.28s -> 5421.08s]  ICU patient becomes cachectic or suffers from muscle waste. And this is the syndrome, right?
[5421.08s -> 5429.16s]  Post-ICU muscle waste syndrome. And this is where, like, why do they get cachectic or catabolic,
[5429.16s -> 5435.40s]  right? And why they overexpress tremendously levels of glutamine, because they need it for either
[5436.28s -> 5437.00s]  enter the
[5437.40s -> 5442.84s]  Krebs Cycle for energy or for gluconeogenesis. So this is one of the things that we learn
[5442.84s -> 5450.60s]  a lot from ICU. These ICU patients, they have hyperglycemia, right? Yet they're not giving
[5450.60s -> 5456.12s]  them usually because they have hyperglycemia. It's true too that in the acute ICU phase,
[5456.68s -> 5462.52s]  they also have insulin resistance, right? But obviously, this hyperglycemia,
[5462.52s -> 5466.28s]  and ICU doctors historically have seen this, it's like, whoa, this patient has
[5466.84s -> 5473.16s]  hyperglycemia of the chart so obviously we're not going to give them ivs of faria alpha glucose
[5473.16s -> 5477.72s]  we're going to give more protein and glucose i mean in fighters and in fact glutamine has shown
[5477.72s -> 5484.92s]  that increased survival right in these patients right but where is this hyperglycemia is coming
[5484.92s -> 5492.36s]  from when you do not have glycogen it comes probably from proteolysis right where you break
[5492.36s -> 5498.36s]  down protein from your muscles to release glutamine but i mean i think we could we would
[5498.36s -> 5503.16s]  only know that if we understood hepatic glucose stores because regardless of how much glycogen
[5503.16s -> 5508.04s]  is in the muscle it's never going to make its way into circulation because the muscle can't fully
[5508.04s -> 5514.60s]  dephosphorylate it so do we have a sense of what the hepatic glycogen content is because i i can't
[5514.60s -> 5522.28s]  imagine the body would ever let anything compromise that given that if the liver can't produce
[5522.36s -> 5529.80s]  glucose continuously the brain dies so it might be that this is true true and unrelated right it
[5529.80s -> 5536.60s]  could be that the the muscles are depleting glycogen because of high utilization but the
[5536.60s -> 5543.72s]  liver through gluconeogenesis has plenty of glucose that's what's making it into the circulation
[5544.36s -> 5549.72s]  because of hypercortisolemia because of other acute phase reactants yeah and so we have
[5549.72s -> 5552.36s]  hyperglycemia but it's all being mediated by the
[5552.36s -> 5557.80s]  liver which has no trouble maintaining glycogen levels and again from an evolutionary perspective
[5557.80s -> 5564.60s]  you much rather err on the side of hyperglycemia than hypoglycemia under a period of stress
[5564.60s -> 5570.20s]  absolutely and it's necessarily and that's i think what's the source of that gluconeogenesis
[5570.20s -> 5576.84s]  right so it's probably uh glutaminolysis right coming from the muscle so this is what um this is
[5576.84s -> 5581.72s]  my hypothesis right that those muscles they eat themselves to feed themselves or to feed the rest
[5581.72s -> 5582.28s]  of the body
[5582.36s -> 5589.24s]  right uh this is why so that would suggest that exercising icu patients would be important right
[5589.24s -> 5594.20s]  so getting getting some load-bearing resistance even of course they're in a bed but you know sort
[5594.20s -> 5601.00s]  of moving their extremities against a load supplementing with amino acids absolutely could
[5601.00s -> 5605.88s]  actually improve outcomes absolutely there's there's a lot of research in this area my
[5605.88s -> 5611.72s]  colleague paul wishmeyer who used to work here with me at the university now he's in duke he's
[5611.72s -> 5617.16s]  doing a lot of research and uh and practical work with that but with it with this is like uh yeah
[5617.16s -> 5622.76s]  this hyperglycemia probably comes from gluconeogenesis um uh and again this is this is
[5622.76s -> 5630.52s]  what to going back to where we started um um yeah could be that there's a lot of um uh glutamine
[5630.52s -> 5635.72s]  released you know when you're also in a ketoacidosis state as well especially in the
[5635.72s -> 5641.48s]  first phases of that right we know cortisol is very high at first the same thing that we see in
[5641.72s -> 5647.24s]  icu patients that that the two main parameters that are predict predictors of mortality at the
[5647.24s -> 5653.96s]  icu is a hyper cortisol anemia high cortisol levels and high lactate levels right they both
[5653.96s -> 5660.52s]  are completely related right um anyways um yeah i think this is this is fascinating there's this
[5660.52s -> 5666.84s]  is a great model to understand um metabolism stress metabolism of these patients uh in the
[5666.84s -> 5671.56s]  icu patients and and that's the other thing too once once you exercise and this is a
[5671.72s -> 5679.48s]  important concept for people with type 2 diabetes with type 1 diabetes and hyperinsulinemia is that
[5679.48s -> 5686.68s]  you have insulin resistance right um and and you have difficulty to translocate therefore to
[5686.68s -> 5692.60s]  translocate the glute for transporters to the surface of the muscle the sarcolemma and we know
[5692.60s -> 5700.36s]  that probably the first tissue or organ where diabetes uh debuts starts is the skeletal muscle
[5701.72s -> 5704.76s]  right and that's where the most of the carbohydrates that we have they're oxidizing
[5705.40s -> 5711.80s]  in skeletal muscle and and because we're at rest are should be oxidized within the mitochondria of
[5711.80s -> 5716.12s]  skeletal muscle that pyruvate right this is what we're doing research and increasing it clearly
[5716.76s -> 5724.28s]  but um but when you have insulin resistance you cannot translocate those transporters
[5724.28s -> 5731.08s]  now we have a second uh a way to translate those transporters that not many people know about and
[5731.72s -> 5732.68s]  so we have a way to translate those transporters that not many people know about and so we have
[5732.68s -> 5738.76s]  right this is the this is the insulin independent glucose uptake which which also seems to be
[5738.76s -> 5745.96s]  heavily dependent on fitness right the fittest athletes here require virtually no insulin
[5745.96s -> 5750.52s]  to translocate glucose into the muscle through the insulin independent pathway
[5751.16s -> 5755.32s]  and actually this i think we may have even discussed this i don't know over dinner one
[5755.32s -> 5761.40s]  night but you look at the type 1 uh diabetics who are highly highly active require very little
[5761.40s -> 5770.28s]  insulin exactly and and this is because they have a and this is this explains um the hypoglycemia
[5770.28s -> 5774.68s]  in these patients shortly after they start exercising right they might have some something
[5774.68s -> 5779.48s]  to eat and they inject themselves with insulin and and there's nothing you can do once you have
[5779.48s -> 5784.76s]  insulin on board right so that insulin is going to translocate those transporters and it's going to
[5784.76s -> 5790.20s]  start bringing insulin inside but in the moment i mean sorry glucose thanks in the moment you start
[5790.20s -> 5791.24s]  exercising
[5791.40s -> 5797.24s]  you do the same function through contraction of exercise of the muscles so you have two mechanisms
[5797.24s -> 5804.52s]  acting at the same time pulling more glucose inside the cells leading to hypoglycemia so this
[5804.52s -> 5809.48s]  is what we we learned a lot with type 1 persons with people with type 1 diabetes in exercise
[5809.48s -> 5814.52s]  but this concept and and then we can prevent them so for example do not inject yourself
[5814.52s -> 5821.24s]  before exercising right because exercise alone is going to take care of that glucose right
[5821.40s -> 5826.44s]  uh but we can take these concepts also with people with type 2 diabetes uh that that they
[5826.44s -> 5832.76s]  have insulin resistance or pre-type 2 diabetes it's like why not exercising right after you eat
[5833.56s -> 5840.04s]  right because that that that carbohydrate you have uh you know like you don't have that you
[5840.04s -> 5845.24s]  have insulin resistance already but when you exercise you're not going to need that insulin
[5845.24s -> 5850.36s]  and yet you can translate those transporters and you bring glucose levels down and i'm sure that
[5851.40s -> 5856.60s]  you see this all the time where your glucose sensors with your text come right yes and and
[5856.60s -> 5861.96s]  and there's i've gone periods of time when i've done incredibly frequent lactate testing so you
[5861.96s -> 5866.76s]  know lactate testing every 30 minutes for a day or something insane like that which is incredibly
[5866.76s -> 5873.40s]  expensive and incredibly painful on your fingers but you learn how much for example a meal
[5873.40s -> 5881.40s]  impacts lactate so um when i wake up in the morning my ret my resting lactate
[5881.40s -> 5886.84s]  level varies between and this is i've been tracking this over a period of
[5888.36s -> 5896.44s]  uh probably 40 days so 40 days of tracking what what range do you think my morning resting lactate
[5896.44s -> 5901.00s]  level has been over a 40-day period how much variability do you in the morning first thing
[5901.00s -> 5907.88s]  in the morning i would say i would say you know like in the neighborhood of 0.8 to 1.2 1.3
[5907.88s -> 5911.16s]  i'm pretty good guess so 0.3 to about 1.3
[5912.04s -> 5921.56s]  okay but that's a pretty big variation yeah um and probably median level of about 0.8 yeah would
[5921.56s -> 5926.76s]  be the medium of wine which is normally in the feed individual right yes so then what i can do
[5926.76s -> 5934.84s]  is i can eat a very high carb breakfast and go and do a zone 2 ride or don't eat anything at all
[5934.84s -> 5941.32s]  and go and do a zone 2 ride very different lactate performance curve absolutely so the high carb
[5941.40s -> 5949.64s]  meal raises lactate it so it becomes a bit of an artifact in a way which now gets me to some of the
[5949.64s -> 5956.60s]  the we've talked about this at the level of the most precision possible the way in which i would
[5956.60s -> 5962.44s]  measure it in a patient you would measure it in a world-class athlete where we have the ability to
[5962.44s -> 5967.72s]  do indirect calorimetry and lactate testing but now i want to talk about it in the way that we train
[5968.76s -> 5970.04s]  people normal people
[5970.04s -> 5970.12s]  mm-hmm
[5970.12s -> 5970.28s]  mm-hmm
[5970.28s -> 5971.32s]  mm-hmm
[5971.32s -> 5977.48s]  we've talked about this um call it you know difference right between
[5978.12s -> 5983.64s]  the lactate level that you measure in the blood which is now heavily influenced by production
[5983.64s -> 5989.00s]  and clearance and then we've talked about the gold standard which would probably be fat oxidation
[5989.00s -> 5994.20s]  but even that can be confounded but let's take off the table the people who are consuming a
[5994.20s -> 6000.36s]  high fat low carbohydrate diet because that confuses things a bit if i have a patient and i'm
[6000.36s -> 6001.08s]  looking at their
[6001.32s -> 6007.80s]  biometrics and we do a zone two test based on looking at their fat oxidation
[6008.44s -> 6012.68s]  during an escalated test of part of a vo2 max test and it comes back
[6012.68s -> 6016.08s]  that their maximum fat oxidation which is
[6016.10s -> 6019.30s]  you know 0.3 grams per minute
[6019.32s -> 6024.76s]  occurs at a wattage of 1.5 watts per kilo
[6024.76s -> 6030.50s]  that's a pretty average person and i say i want that number higher
[6030.50s -> 6030.72s]  mm-hmm
[6030.72s -> 6030.96s]  mm-hmm
[6030.96s -> 6031.02s]  mm-hmm
[6031.02s -> 6031.06s]  mm-hmm
[6031.06s -> 6031.10s]  mm-hmm
[6031.10s -> 6031.32s]  mm-hmm
[6031.32s -> 6037.80s]  the absolute number of fat oxidation, but where it occurs on the graph. Now I want you in a year
[6037.80s -> 6046.22s]  to be 2.5 Watts per kilo. Let's talk about two things. One, how they should train. And that
[6046.22s -> 6054.48s]  means duration, intensity, frequency, et cetera. And secondly, what we should use as the readout
[6054.48s -> 6060.20s]  to know we're in the right training zone, given that they won't be able to train daily or weekly
[6060.20s -> 6065.74s]  or whatever frequency within direct calorimetry. And by the way, let's assume that some people
[6065.74s -> 6071.48s]  will want to use the point of care lactate meters and some people will not. So let's start with
[6071.48s -> 6077.80s]  what's our surrogate for training zone and starting with what we knew. So we learned that
[6077.80s -> 6085.06s]  1.5 Watts per kilo was maximum fat oxidation, but we want to increase that to 2.5. So
[6085.06s -> 6090.16s]  what metric do you use to train them? So, yes, normally what I do is like,
[6090.20s -> 6098.36s]  starting with the metabolic test, I translate that information into whether it's Watts or speed
[6098.36s -> 6104.82s]  or heart rate. All of them, normally they correlate quite well. And you can individualize it. There
[6104.82s -> 6109.94s]  are people that don't have a power meter. Okay. You can do heart rate, for example, or people
[6109.94s -> 6115.44s]  that just, obviously they run or they walk. You can do speed or heart rate as well. They're very
[6115.44s -> 6119.04s]  good surrogate. So that's the first metric, the surrogate, right?
[6120.20s -> 6127.36s]  It's about, at least from my experience, the three main principles that I've learned over the years
[6127.36s -> 6133.52s]  and how to apply this. So first is a frequency. How many...
[6133.52s -> 6137.58s]  Before we go to the frequency and the duration, I do want to go back and ask you another question.
[6137.98s -> 6143.92s]  We have some patients who don't want to use a lactate meter either because it's cumbersome
[6143.92s -> 6150.18s]  or somewhat intimidating. We also add another metric, which is relative perceived exertion.
[6150.20s -> 6157.42s]  RPE. I'll tell you what my rule of thumb is, but I'd like you to sharpen it, refine it,
[6157.54s -> 6162.76s]  throw it out, make it better, whatever. I tell patients based on my experience. So I don't know
[6162.76s -> 6172.52s]  how extrapolatable that is. When I'm in zone two, as confirmed by lactate levels, so call it 1.7 to
[6172.52s -> 6179.90s]  1.9 millimole, which is what I target. I can carry out a conversation. So I can spend my entire
[6180.20s -> 6185.92s]  because I do most of mine on a Wahoo kicker. I put my bike on a Wahoo kicker. I can spend the
[6185.92s -> 6193.10s]  entire 45 minutes on a phone call. Yes, absolutely. But it's not as comfortable as this discussion
[6193.10s -> 6200.66s]  here. Exactly. I'm a little more strained. Yeah. But if I can't talk, if I feel like I can't talk,
[6201.02s -> 6206.98s]  I'm too high in the intensity. Yeah. Do you think that that's a reasonable surrogate for people to
[6206.98s -> 6209.66s]  use across the spectrum of...
[6210.20s -> 6213.14s]  Not particularly fit all the way up to Pogacar?
[6213.70s -> 6221.02s]  1,000%. And I use the same metrics also with people who, like you mentioned, they don't want
[6221.02s -> 6227.90s]  to do a hard lactate meter or they don't have access or they... I get hundreds of emails about
[6227.90s -> 6238.06s]  where can I do this test? Or is there anything that I can do? And I agree 100% that with everything
[6238.06s -> 6240.06s]  that we know at the growth...
[6240.20s -> 6241.20s]  Yeah.
[6241.20s -> 6245.36s]  We can't get a granular cellular level by injecting fuels and substrates directly into the mitochondria.
[6245.36s -> 6251.52s]  We cannot get more cellular level and scientific like that. The surrogate or the specific exertion,
[6251.52s -> 6256.64s]  it works beautifully. I know that people are coming out with different algorithms based on
[6256.64s -> 6264.00s]  heart rate variability or the TFA, 1 alpha, et cetera. But honestly, I agree 100% with you.
[6264.80s -> 6269.52s]  If you can... I always tell people, if you can exercise, whatever the exercise you do,
[6270.20s -> 6273.92s]  and maintain a conversation like you and I are doing, you're way too easy. You're probably
[6273.92s -> 6281.56s]  in zone one. If you can talk, but it's some form of strain. You can talk for two hours, right?
[6282.16s -> 6284.12s]  But we're talking a little bit like that.
[6284.12s -> 6290.04s]  Yeah, you're just at that threshold of... Put it this way. The other litmus test I tell people is
[6290.04s -> 6293.32s]  the person on the other end will know you are exercising.
[6293.70s -> 6294.14s]  Exactly.
[6294.16s -> 6297.68s]  You will not be able to mask from them that you are exercising.
[6297.68s -> 6299.68s]  Exactly. And in fact, I have...
[6300.20s -> 6306.04s]  Many conference calls with people that I know to be respectful, but I do it on the bike.
[6308.28s -> 6313.56s]  As you said, they call me and I'm on the bike, either outside or in the trainer, and they tell
[6313.56s -> 6319.08s]  like, you're exercising, right? Because you can feel it. But yet, I can maintain a full hour
[6319.08s -> 6324.52s]  meeting on the bike, right? And without bothering the other person, because they can understand me.
[6324.52s -> 6329.24s]  But as I said, if you cross to the point where you cannot maintain that conversation,
[6329.24s -> 6330.18s]  that's what you're doing. That's what you're doing. That's what you're doing. That's what you're
[6330.20s -> 6335.24s]  doing. And that's where you... It's because, yeah, you need to breathe much faster because
[6335.24s -> 6339.48s]  you're producing more CO2. And that's probably because you're already transitioning from the
[6339.48s -> 6344.28s]  slow twitch muscle fibers to the fast twitch muscle fibers, more glycolytic, more lactate,
[6344.28s -> 6349.72s]  more CO2, more buffering capacity. So it seems old school, but it works beautifully.
[6349.72s -> 6354.52s]  Agreed. And the other thing I do, because I really like people to triangulate and give
[6354.52s -> 6360.04s]  them a starting point. So if someone has not done a metabolic test yet, and we're just... And that's
[6360.04s -> 6363.96s]  usually the case, by the way, is that we're starting with just a zone two training protocol.
[6365.00s -> 6369.96s]  I also give them some ranges on heart rate. Now, here I have found much more variability.
[6369.96s -> 6375.08s]  So the first thing I say is, to do this, you do need to know your maximum heart rate,
[6375.08s -> 6379.08s]  not your predicted maximum heart rate, but your actual achieved maximum heart rate.
[6380.12s -> 6387.96s]  In my experience, personally, so this is... I don't know how much I can extrapolate this. My zone two
[6388.76s -> 6390.02s]  is actually at about 70% of my heart rate. And that's a lot of heart rate. And that's a lot of
[6390.02s -> 6394.58s]  heart rate. So I tell people, I am making scheduled stops at least seven percent of my
[6394.58s -> 6398.98s]  heart rate. If I'm talking about 80 to 80% of my heart rate, I'm saying it's lower than that.
[6398.98s -> 6402.66s]  So I tell people, I am telling people, I am saying this is a much lower range,
[6402.66s -> 6407.06s]  70 to 80% of your realized maximum heart rate is a good place to start.
[6407.94s -> 6410.82s]  But I know that for less trained people, it's lower.
[6410.82s -> 6416.82s]  So I tell people, a broad range of 70 to 80% of your realized maximum heart rate is a good place
[6416.82s -> 6418.98s]  to start and then make adjustments based on relative perceived exertion.
[6418.98s -> 6423.46s]  say the same thing, somewhere between 70 to 80. That being said, if you want to-
[6423.46s -> 6424.58s]  That's a big range.
[6424.58s -> 6432.18s]  It's a big range. Exactly. So you can be at 70, let's say at 1.7 millimoles, and then at 80,
[6432.18s -> 6437.54s]  you can be at five millimoles. So you're completely away from one zone. But as you said,
[6437.54s -> 6442.58s]  it's a good starting point. And then as you very well said, and I agree 100% with you is like,
[6442.58s -> 6448.98s]  yeah, then you tweak it with your perceived exertion. I agree. The other thing too,
[6448.98s -> 6455.94s]  with the heart rate, and this is where the heart rate variability, there are different
[6455.94s -> 6461.70s]  interpretations. So the modern interpretation of heart rate variability is the differences between
[6461.70s -> 6470.34s]  bit to bit. And that's where there are different algorithms. For me, the heart rate variability,
[6471.14s -> 6472.18s]  it's more at a broader
[6472.74s -> 6481.38s]  spectrum and it's more on the, you know, the adrenergic activation that you have. So for
[6481.38s -> 6488.10s]  example, you're fatigued today, right? First of all, normally, you're going to wake up with your
[6488.10s -> 6494.74s]  resting heart rate a little bit higher than normally. So that, if your normal heart rate,
[6494.74s -> 6501.62s]  let's say it's 50 and you're in fatigue, you might wake up with 65. So that alone is a heart rate
[6501.62s -> 6502.26s]  variability.
[6502.58s -> 6508.28s]  it varies from from the norm to one day so that's our red flag that you might be
[6508.28s -> 6512.72s]  tired that day might not happen all the day I mean might not be super sensitive
[6512.72s -> 6516.96s]  but it is very sensitive for elite athletes without a doubt the second
[6516.96s -> 6521.00s]  aspect is like when you go out there and exercise as you might see there are days
[6521.00s -> 6525.20s]  that you are like a hundred and thirty beats per minute whatever you think
[6525.20s -> 6532.22s]  you're going to is 130 138 for example but some days it's really hard to get
[6532.22s -> 6537.20s]  the heart rate by extremely hard and you're already struggling are 110 beats
[6537.20s -> 6541.88s]  per minute or 115 beats per minute well that's not the norm that's another
[6541.88s -> 6545.96s]  deviation that's a variability of the heart right so this is what I've been
[6545.96s -> 6550.76s]  historically used for hairy heart rate variability which tells me a lot more
[6550.76s -> 6555.26s]  information this is what all the athletes also tell you like man my
[6555.26s -> 6559.46s]  heart rate doesn't get up today you see on training pics you know you see when
[6559.46s -> 6562.00s]  someone is fatigued they do an interval and they know they
[6562.00s -> 6562.20s]  all get up at the same time and they get up at the same time and they get up at the same time
[6562.22s -> 6566.96s]  it's 180 185 let's say the lactate threshold and today they cannot get up
[6566.96s -> 6571.70s]  until more than 170 you see in the competition the first week of the Tour
[6571.70s -> 6577.58s]  de France their maximum maximal heart rate let's say it's 195 last week the
[6577.58s -> 6583.22s]  maximum heart rate is a 170 right that's that's what I interpret by heart rate
[6583.22s -> 6586.70s]  variability and I know that a lot of people might criticize me because all
[6586.70s -> 6590.96s]  that has nothing to do well I respect all that no I think it's macro versus
[6590.96s -> 6592.00s]  micro I agree
[6592.00s -> 6595.62s]  is how I read it as macro versus micro yeah I'll share with you an interesting
[6595.62s -> 6599.32s]  self experiment I've done a couple of times it's not pleasant but it's
[6599.32s -> 6605.26s]  interesting if I take a huge dose of a beta blocker and the only beta blocker
[6605.26s -> 6608.94s]  you can do this with if you if you have low blood pressure as I do you have to
[6608.94s -> 6613.10s]  be careful but propranolol is fine because it really it
[6613.10s -> 6617.22s]  disproportionately lowers heart rate but not blood pressure but I've done this
[6617.22s -> 6621.68s]  experiment a few times to test an idea which is would
[6622.00s -> 6627.16s]  taking all of the gas out of my heart rate allow me to push harder and
[6627.16s -> 6635.08s]  generate a higher zone two and it turns out it does so if so my zone two is you
[6635.08s -> 6637.94s]  know just under three watts per kilo I really want to talk with you about
[6637.94s -> 6642.62s]  getting over three watts per kilo I'm still furious because in July remember I
[6642.62s -> 6647.98s]  was at 2.95 I was just kissing on the door of three and I've actually come
[6647.98s -> 6651.82s]  back to do it I've come back you know I'm now at about two point seven five
[6651.82s -> 6659.06s]  5 to 2.85. So I've lost a bit. Um, no, I think we're going to talk about training in a moment.
[6659.06s -> 6664.00s]  So, but what I noticed, so, and for me, I'm at that upper end of maximum heart rate. So,
[6664.08s -> 6670.28s]  so I'm going to be doing that at about 80, 81% of maximum heart rate. But when, if I took
[6670.28s -> 6676.68s]  propranolol, you know, 60 milligrams of a time release propranolol, I will be able to get over
[6676.68s -> 6686.38s]  three Watts per kilo and I'll do it at a heart rate of 68% of maximum. Yeah. But it feels horrible.
[6686.72s -> 6694.26s]  Yeah. I feel like I'm going to die. Yeah. It is the worst feeling in the world. It is like somebody
[6694.26s -> 6701.42s]  has, and it's not pain. It's, it's not like, I don't know how to explain it other than it feels
[6701.42s -> 6706.66s]  like what it feels like when you're overtrained. It feels like you just can't, you can't,
[6706.68s -> 6713.96s]  can't get moving. It's like an engine that's being taken from 9,000 RPM to 6,000 RPM. Yeah.
[6714.06s -> 6718.76s]  But yet somehow is able to generate the horsepower, but it just doesn't feel right. So,
[6719.48s -> 6725.00s]  you know, that, that's sort of my, um, uh, that's, that's my drug cheating way to ramp,
[6725.16s -> 6728.66s]  to get over three Watts per kilo, but more to illustrate the point, right. Which is when you
[6728.66s -> 6734.48s]  put the governor on heart rate, you can, you can get there, um, at a lower heart rate, but it,
[6734.48s -> 6736.46s]  but there's just some subjectively,
[6736.68s -> 6742.00s]  a miserable feeling. Yeah, no, absolutely. It's, uh, um, yeah. And this is kind of in a way
[6742.00s -> 6748.14s]  what happens when, when you're fatigued, when you don't have enough fuel. Right. So, uh, again,
[6748.14s -> 6752.96s]  going back to like my heart, it doesn't get up today and I'm struggling kind of like, you know,
[6752.96s -> 6758.50s]  it's like if you were taking some better blocker, right. Uh, but the thing is that it has to do a
[6758.50s -> 6765.36s]  lot with fuel. Uh, and, and, and, and for example, and I experiment this a lot too. I, I, I try to
[6765.36s -> 6766.66s]  understand how this works. So I, I, I try to understand how this works. So I, I, I, I try to
[6766.68s -> 6773.62s]  do maybe the intermittent fasting for a few days and I go out there and I'm not good at adjusting
[6773.62s -> 6779.78s]  at that. And I, I cannot do that. I know others can do it and I admire that. Uh, but I can see
[6779.78s -> 6785.92s]  my heart rate right away. Right. Um, when you don't have enough glycogen storages, um, um,
[6785.92s -> 6790.98s]  it's very possible that adrenergic activity is decreased. You need to break down glycogen.
[6791.24s -> 6795.70s]  And we know that, um, uh, what it takes to break down glycogen is for spherulase,
[6795.82s -> 6796.50s]  right.
[6796.68s -> 6802.22s]  In the, in the muscle. And that's directly regulated by, um, um, um, um, catecholamines.
[6802.60s -> 6808.56s]  Right. So when there's, um, a decrease in glycogen, this is my hypothesis, right? When
[6808.56s -> 6814.80s]  there's a decrease in glycogen storages, um, because of the evolutionary mechanisms that
[6814.80s -> 6820.14s]  humans have, the brain is the boss, right? The brain says like, I don't care about your legs,
[6820.14s -> 6825.84s]  but don't, don't use up all the glycogen because you have to give me, and the liver has to give
[6825.84s -> 6826.66s]  me glycogen as well.
[6827.02s -> 6832.44s]  So I'm not going to shut you down completely of breaking down glycogen, but I'm going to slow you
[6832.44s -> 6837.56s]  down. So I'm going to release less catecholamines so that you break down glycogen.
[6837.56s -> 6838.74s]  Release less glycogen, yeah.
[6838.80s -> 6845.22s]  Now, um, um, the collateral effect of that is the heart because the heart contractility is
[6845.22s -> 6850.56s]  regulated by catecholamines as well. So this is why using that, my version of heart rate
[6850.56s -> 6856.02s]  variability, it's quite useful. I've been using it incredibly successfully for 25 years with my
[6856.02s -> 6856.38s]  athletes.
[6856.68s -> 6862.62s]  Uh, where I see that, hey, your heart rate is not going up today. You know, uh, usually it's 185,
[6862.62s -> 6869.16s]  190, for example, when you do a lactic threshold, for example, and today it was 170. So tomorrow,
[6869.16s -> 6874.50s]  take it easy or pile up on glycogen. I mean, on carbohydrates or take an easy day and you'll see
[6874.50s -> 6879.00s]  how you're going to be very responsive the next day, the following day. And in fact, that's what
[6879.00s -> 6883.98s]  happens. I would say 10 out of 10 times, but let's say nine out of 10 times, right? But I do that
[6883.98s -> 6884.88s]  with myself as well.
[6884.88s -> 6885.14s]  Yeah.
[6885.14s -> 6885.16s]  Yeah.
[6885.16s -> 6885.30s]  Yeah.
[6885.30s -> 6885.42s]  Yeah.
[6885.42s -> 6885.56s]  Yeah.
[6885.56s -> 6885.64s]  Yeah.
[6885.64s -> 6885.70s]  Yeah.
[6885.70s -> 6885.74s]  Yeah.
[6885.74s -> 6885.76s]  Yeah.
[6885.76s -> 6885.78s]  Yeah.
[6885.78s -> 6885.82s]  Yeah.
[6885.82s -> 6885.86s]  Yeah.
[6885.86s -> 6885.88s]  Yeah.
[6885.88s -> 6885.90s]  Yeah.
[6885.90s -> 6885.92s]  Yeah.
[6885.92s -> 6885.94s]  Yeah.
[6885.94s -> 6885.98s]  Yeah.
[6885.98s -> 6886.00s]  Yeah.
[6886.00s -> 6886.02s]  Yeah.
[6886.68s -> 6886.90s]  Yeah.
[6886.90s -> 6887.04s]  Yeah.
[6887.34s -> 6893.28s]  Um, that I don't, I mean, I, I work a lot with the head, you know, so, you know, you think a lot
[6893.28s -> 6900.26s]  and the brain uses about 100 to 125 grams of glucose daily, right. When, when you go, and I
[6900.26s -> 6905.66s]  don't know that fact, you know, but when you know, when, when you work a lot of hours and thinking
[6905.66s -> 6911.66s]  and thinking and thinking and stressed, um, I'm sure that obviously the, the, the brain might
[6911.66s -> 6916.66s]  need a lot more glucose. So that's, that's training your, your glycogenous storage is
[6916.66s -> 6920.66s]  from the brain, probably, and even from the muscles, because the muscle can release glucose.
[6920.92s -> 6921.34s]  It can?
[6921.80s -> 6931.32s]  Yes. The muscle has phosphorylase and can degrade the glycogen, and that glucose can go to the
[6931.32s -> 6936.72s]  circulation as well to feed other organs. I didn't realize that we had glucose 1-phosphatase
[6936.72s -> 6941.84s]  in the muscle. I thought the muscle glycogen fate was sealed in the muscle.
[6941.84s -> 6947.72s]  No, it's possible. There are a few studies. I'm happy to send them to you. I cannot refer them
[6947.72s -> 6956.72s]  out of memory, but yeah, the muscles can also release glucose and export glucose outside.
[6956.74s -> 6958.96s]  I assume this is a relatively small amount.
[6959.48s -> 6964.76s]  Yes. I don't have it on the top of my mind. Yeah, absolutely. Exactly. But it's possible too.
[6965.44s -> 6969.42s]  But what I mean, and I know what you're saying, yeah, so those days where I'm thinking a lot and
[6969.42s -> 6971.50s]  I'm not very stressed, and I'm not...
[6971.84s -> 6977.30s]  You know, like dieting or anything, I just go out there and I'm dead. And I'm sure that many
[6977.30s -> 6981.92s]  people listening to this feel the same way. Like, what the hell is going on today? I don't have
[6981.92s -> 6987.66s]  energy at all today, you know? And you will see that your heart rate doesn't get up those days.
[6988.82s -> 6993.98s]  And you can get to that by just training five hours a week or seven hours a week. And sometimes
[6993.98s -> 6998.22s]  people say like, look, I cannot be overtrained because I only train five hours a week. Yeah,
[6998.22s -> 6999.54s]  but you're overworked.
[7000.26s -> 7000.32s]  Yeah.
[7000.44s -> 7001.14s]  And that doesn't...
[7001.84s -> 7006.30s]  That's a big artifact when you're training. That's what most of us aspire to pre-retire
[7006.30s -> 7012.26s]  before 60, you know, so we can have more time to exercise, right? And less time to work.
[7012.90s -> 7022.76s]  But yeah, that's what I do this. I take a day off completely. I sleep more. I increase my
[7022.76s -> 7029.10s]  carbohydrate intake. And the following day, I can even break my PR on a climb or something. I feel
[7029.10s -> 7030.24s]  like a million dollars.
[7030.24s -> 7031.70s]  So resting.
[7031.84s -> 7033.12s]  Recovery is key for that.
[7033.12s -> 7037.54s]  Yeah, I think that's a very important point. And it's actually something I've only been able to
[7037.54s -> 7046.82s]  pay attention to in the last year, which is I used to judge my performance by training load. So,
[7047.06s -> 7051.66s]  you know, again, I used to use training peaks when I was training. I don't anymore. But the
[7051.66s -> 7058.36s]  concepts of acute and chronic training balance, and it was, you know, any day that was suboptimal
[7058.36s -> 7061.62s]  could be explained by training volume in some capacity.
[7062.36s -> 7067.20s]  But now, you know, my training volume is relatively low. It's 10 hours a week of total training. That's
[7067.20s -> 7073.00s]  both, you know, cardio and strength. So that's, this is not a lot of training. And yet when I'm
[7073.00s -> 7079.84s]  under stress, work-wise, you know, I'm just doing too much. I don't even use the word stress. It has
[7079.84s -> 7086.00s]  a real negative connotation to it. I just mean when I'm overworked, when I'm doing too much,
[7086.72s -> 7091.60s]  my performance, I have to either adjust my parameters for what I deem success,
[7091.84s -> 7099.90s]  or I just have to sort of cut back on the actual training a little bit to make time for more sleep
[7099.90s -> 7109.06s]  or more relaxation. And so I think that's a very important point that is easily lost. So let's now,
[7109.06s -> 7114.54s]  so we've got a very good handle on the metrics we're going to be using. So now let's talk about
[7114.54s -> 7121.02s]  two scenarios. The first is the person who is new to this type of training. So they've listened to
[7121.02s -> 7121.56s]  this podcast.
[7122.18s -> 7128.08s]  Or they're one of my patients and I've made the case convincingly to them that you really need
[7128.08s -> 7134.70s]  to do this type of training. I want to come back by the way, to a justification for that. So let's
[7134.70s -> 7138.90s]  explain why high intensity training is not sufficient, but we'll, we'll park that for a
[7138.90s -> 7143.48s]  moment, but they really don't have much of a background in this type of training, right? They,
[7144.22s -> 7147.98s]  you know, maybe they do some high intensity training, they do some weights, they play some
[7147.98s -> 7151.68s]  tennis, uh, but they really don't do this sort of steady state.
[7151.84s -> 7157.84s]  They don't do that kind of sustained cardio that we're talking about. Um, how would you structure a
[7157.84s -> 7164.96s]  training program in dose, duration, frequency, uh, for that individual and tell me a little bit about
[7164.96s -> 7172.06s]  the choices that you would make it make if they're agnostic to running, walking, cycling, rowing,
[7172.06s -> 7176.40s]  swimming, you know, again, I have my biases there, but I want to kind of hear what you have to say
[7176.40s -> 7176.74s]  about it.
[7177.40s -> 7179.74s]  Yeah, no, yeah, that's a great question.
[7179.96s -> 7188.36s]  And I also, before that, I want to apologize to many of your audience because I get a lot
[7188.36s -> 7192.54s]  of emails, you know, asking me about these questions and it's hard to...
[7192.54s -> 7195.16s]  Well, that's why we're doing the podcast so that you don't have to apologize.
[7195.44s -> 7196.32s]  It's easier to do it this way.
[7196.32s -> 7197.58s]  I appreciate it this way.
[7197.58s -> 7204.02s]  But see, I get emails and before I used to see people here at the university, but now
[7204.02s -> 7207.08s]  at the university, you know, we don't have these services.
[7207.34s -> 7211.66s]  So I'm trying to convince them that these services are important to offer to the population.
[7211.84s -> 7215.22s]  But anyways, I want to apologize because I cannot answer to everybody.
[7215.80s -> 7222.04s]  But yeah, so I have the three main rules or parameters that I have learned over the years.
[7222.14s -> 7223.96s]  So one is the duration, right?
[7224.06s -> 7229.98s]  We have in mind sometimes that this is like endurance training, long days, like I only
[7229.98s -> 7233.56s]  have six hours a week or seven hours a week at most, right?
[7233.56s -> 7235.66s]  To do this type of training or less.
[7235.92s -> 7237.58s]  So there's no way I can do that.
[7237.76s -> 7241.52s]  It's usually less because they might have six hours a week for total exercise.
[7241.78s -> 7242.22s]  Exactly.
[7242.34s -> 7244.38s]  And we're going to take half of that for strength training.
[7244.70s -> 7245.14s]  Exactly.
[7245.40s -> 7253.16s]  Because which is very important, as you know, it's where I fail because I should do more
[7253.16s -> 7253.54s]  of that.
[7253.88s -> 7256.90s]  And I try to get a little bit more of time to do that.
[7257.04s -> 7261.22s]  But it's not easy, but I aspire really to dial that in.
[7261.48s -> 7262.92s]  But yeah, you're right.
[7263.00s -> 7263.54s]  They might have less.
[7263.56s -> 7264.26s]  They might have less than six hours.
[7264.46s -> 7267.70s]  And they might think like, well, I'm not an endurance athlete.
[7268.02s -> 7270.94s]  So you need to do four hours to accomplish this.
[7271.02s -> 7275.50s]  So therefore, I'm just going to move to do just high intensity and just get out of the
[7275.50s -> 7275.66s]  way.
[7276.10s -> 7279.18s]  Well, that's not completely true, right?
[7279.34s -> 7285.76s]  You can accomplish very important mitochondrial adaptations and very important metabolic
[7285.76s -> 7289.24s]  adaptations by exercising one hour, right?
[7289.42s -> 7292.92s]  So this is one is the duration.
[7292.92s -> 7293.38s]  Let's start.
[7293.38s -> 7294.34s]  Let's start by the duration, right?
[7294.42s -> 7301.04s]  So if you try to do that one hour to one hour and a half range, you're on target.
[7301.86s -> 7303.58s]  And is that in one setting?
[7304.28s -> 7304.98s]  I'm sorry.
[7305.14s -> 7306.82s]  Is that total or one setting?
[7307.66s -> 7308.46s]  What do you mean?
[7309.12s -> 7315.08s]  Meaning is it one to one and a half hours per week or does that need to be in one continuous
[7315.08s -> 7317.06s]  exercise bout?
[7317.46s -> 7318.10s]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[7318.30s -> 7321.96s]  Let me maybe go back to that frequency, right?
[7321.96s -> 7322.54s]  The dose.
[7322.54s -> 7329.08s]  So the frequency that I see is that this type of training ideally needs to be done between
[7329.08s -> 7335.26s]  three to four days a week, ideally what I've seen and how can I know this?
[7335.92s -> 7340.30s]  I know this because I've seen in the laboratory everything, right?
[7340.30s -> 7345.14s]  The person who trains one day at these zones for two days or three days or four days or high
[7345.14s -> 7347.80s]  intensity, low intensity and I see the adaptations.
[7348.10s -> 7349.36s]  How do I see the adaptations?
[7349.36s -> 7352.42s]  Again, looking at mitochondria, I mean, that fat oxidation.
[7352.54s -> 7356.50s]  Lactate cleanse capacity, both surrogates of mitochondrial function, right?
[7356.50s -> 7360.22s]  So I've been identifying the dose of that training.
[7360.22s -> 7365.68s]  So if you train once a week there, chances are that you're going to deteriorate over
[7365.68s -> 7367.42s]  time and especially as we age.
[7368.10s -> 7374.32s]  Something that I see, for example, in high intensity exercisers and bodybuilders, that
[7374.32s -> 7381.16s]  they have a very poor mitochondrial function compared to people who do more, a little bit
[7381.16s -> 7382.30s]  of everything, right?
[7382.54s -> 7384.88s]  So one day a week is not going to work.
[7384.88s -> 7391.54s]  Two days a week, it might maintain what you have, but if you are new to an exercise program,
[7391.54s -> 7392.74s]  might not be enough.
[7393.10s -> 7397.66s]  Three days a week, now we're starting to see for sure.
[7397.66s -> 7402.30s]  Four days a week, now we're talking ideally five days a week or six, but not everybody
[7402.30s -> 7404.00s]  has obviously six days a week to train.
[7404.00s -> 7406.70s]  But I think that we all can.
[7406.70s -> 7408.40s]  I mean, you are a very busy guy.
[7408.40s -> 7409.54s]  I'm a very busy guy.
[7409.78s -> 7412.10s]  And we try to squeeze four or five days a week.
[7412.10s -> 7417.82s]  Maybe six in the summer, but four or five days, it's achievable for most individuals
[7417.82s -> 7421.76s]  and put aside an hour to an hour and a half, right?
[7421.76s -> 7426.16s]  So I would say that four days a week is ideal, right?
[7426.16s -> 7427.56s]  That's the first principle.
[7427.56s -> 7432.14s]  The second principle is the duration, going back to what I was saying, right?
[7432.14s -> 7440.10s]  With one hour, maybe Pogacar needs four hours, five hours to keep increasing those huge mitochondria
[7440.10s -> 7441.54s]  for a long time.
[7441.54s -> 7446.86s]  But a mere model, especially someone who might be pre-diabetic or might be out of fitness
[7446.86s -> 7452.82s]  or hasn't exercised in a long time or someone who's coming from a disease or a mother who
[7452.82s -> 7460.26s]  just had a baby and has been out of, say, for a while, one hour, if you walk or if you
[7460.26s -> 7464.38s]  run, might be very, very good for you.
[7464.38s -> 7468.48s]  One hour walk or run, you might have to bring it up.
[7468.48s -> 7470.06s]  That's part of the plan too, right?
[7470.06s -> 7471.22s]  You cannot start off the bat.
[7471.54s -> 7475.36s]  With one hour, you might start by 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, increasing it.
[7475.76s -> 7476.54s]  It may be about an hour.
[7476.54s -> 7482.60s]  And if you bike, for example, about an hour, 20 minutes, hour and a half, that's what I
[7482.60s -> 7486.84s]  see that if you do that for four days a week, things are starting to move.
[7487.60s -> 7492.70s]  Even if you bike on a trainer where you can be much more efficient and you can really
[7492.70s -> 7494.46s]  get straight to the wattage and stay there?
[7494.54s -> 7499.22s]  Because we tell patients, again, it depends where they are in their cycle, but if they're
[7499.22s -> 7501.42s]  starting out, I mean, we'll be happy if they give us...
[7501.54s -> 7508.36s]  30 minutes, three to four times a week of dedicated exercise.
[7508.36s -> 7509.78s]  So do you see a difference between...
[7509.78s -> 7511.74s]  I can't do zone two on the road.
[7511.74s -> 7513.82s]  I can really only do it on the trainer.
[7513.82s -> 7519.22s]  I just can't stay at a constant level on the road with starting and stopping and wind and
[7519.22s -> 7521.10s]  hills and stuff like that.
[7521.10s -> 7522.10s]  That's a very good point.
[7522.10s -> 7527.40s]  That's why an hour and a half on the bike, it might actually be one hour or so, right?
[7527.40s -> 7528.40s]  Because you have all these artifacts.
[7528.40s -> 7529.40s]  But you're right.
[7529.40s -> 7530.54s]  When you're on the trainer, you isolate everything completely.
[7530.54s -> 7531.54s]  Yeah.
[7531.54s -> 7532.54s]  Completely.
[7532.54s -> 7535.78s]  And what I also recommend is about an hour if you can get there.
[7535.78s -> 7539.08s]  But again, yeah, sure, you might...
[7539.08s -> 7543.70s]  To me, it feels like a torture sometimes to be an hour on the trainer.
[7543.70s -> 7544.70s]  I hate it.
[7544.70s -> 7546.10s]  I like to be outside.
[7546.10s -> 7547.46s]  But we have to do it.
[7547.46s -> 7548.46s]  I do it.
[7548.46s -> 7551.10s]  I watch a movie or just catch up on work.
[7551.10s -> 7558.08s]  I have one with special desks where I can type or read articles or answers in emails.
[7558.08s -> 7560.54s]  Low key activity, because again, you're not very sharp to think.
[7560.54s -> 7561.54s]  Very intellectually.
[7561.54s -> 7562.54s]  But yeah, one hour might do the trick.
[7562.54s -> 7563.54s]  What I've seen is like, yeah, in those people who haven't done much at all, even 30 minutes,
[7563.54s -> 7564.54s]  20 minutes might start moving the needle.
[7564.54s -> 7565.54s]  But eventually, it's not enough dose, right?
[7565.54s -> 7566.54s]  It's like the body needs more, right?
[7566.54s -> 7567.54s]  So if you can get to a goal about an hour to an hour and a half, that should really
[7567.54s -> 7568.54s]  work, in my modest opinion, in my experience.
[7568.54s -> 7569.54s]  So that's the trick.
[7569.54s -> 7570.54s]  Yeah.
[7570.54s -> 7571.54s]  Yeah.
[7571.54s -> 7572.54s]  Yeah.
[7572.54s -> 7573.54s]  Yeah.
[7573.54s -> 7574.54s]  Yeah.
[7574.54s -> 7575.54s]  Yeah.
[7575.54s -> 7576.54s]  Yeah.
[7576.54s -> 7577.54s]  Yeah.
[7577.54s -> 7578.54s]  Yeah.
[7578.54s -> 7579.54s]  Yeah.
[7579.54s -> 7580.54s]  Yeah.
[7580.54s -> 7581.54s]  Yeah.
[7581.54s -> 7582.54s]  Yeah.
[7582.54s -> 7583.54s]  Yeah.
[7583.54s -> 7584.54s]  Yeah.
[7584.54s -> 7585.54s]  Yeah.
[7585.54s -> 7586.54s]  Yeah.
[7586.54s -> 7587.54s]  Yeah.
[7587.54s -> 7588.54s]  Yeah.
[7588.54s -> 7589.54s]  Yeah.
[7589.54s -> 7590.54s]  Yeah.
[7590.54s -> 7591.54s]  Yeah.
[7591.54s -> 7592.54s]  Yeah.
[7592.54s -> 7593.54s]  Yeah.
[7593.54s -> 7594.54s]  Yeah.
[7594.54s -> 7595.54s]  Yeah.
[7595.54s -> 7596.54s]  Yeah.
[7596.54s -> 7597.54s]  Yeah.
[7597.54s -> 7598.54s]  And that's the duration.
[7598.54s -> 7599.54s]  And the third is always the frequency, which we have talked about, which is usually the
[7599.54s -> 7600.54s]  Zone 2.
[7600.54s -> 7605.98s]  That being said, I think that is also important to stimulate other energy systems like the
[7605.98s -> 7607.76s]  glycolytic system.
[7607.76s -> 7610.90s]  And again, continue with the model that we do with НеLead Athletes.
[7610.90s -> 7616.48s]  People think that NeLead Athletes, whatever the sport are, all they do is high intensity
[7616.48s -> 7619.54s]  all the time and intervals, intervals.
[7619.54s -> 7626.22s]  is the exact opposite if you look at the workload of uh of an elite athlete where whether that elite
[7626.22s -> 7631.42s]  athlete is uh especially in individual sports right it's easier to to see this whether it's
[7631.42s -> 7637.12s]  a triathlete or a cyclist or a marathon runner or a swimmer right which is uh like a hundred
[7637.12s -> 7642.48s]  meter swimmer is under a minute right it's maximal exercise if you look at the workload
[7642.48s -> 7647.86s]  it's very similar right the majority of the sessions are in the lower intensity they're
[7647.86s -> 7653.40s]  not intervals intervals intervals and i always say we cannot be so naive to think that you know
[7653.40s -> 7657.10s]  like the best coaches and athletes in the world haven't figured this out when they're always trying
[7657.10s -> 7663.02s]  new things and they want to try the cut and edge things obviously they have said like oh our sport
[7663.02s -> 7668.46s]  is swimming it's under a minute all we need to do is like intervals intervals intervals intervals
[7668.46s -> 7674.36s]  right well if you look at what swimmers do they train and if you ask michael phelps you know
[7674.36s -> 7677.24s]  hours and hours and hours and hours and hours
[7677.24s -> 7677.84s]  you
[7677.84s -> 7684.72s]  can travel through the competition in that under a minute with a slightly better function to clear
[7684.72s -> 7692.78s]  lactate even if it's one millimole uh or less uh the muscle contraction force might be improved
[7692.78s -> 7698.58s]  so all the hours and hours and hours might be that just to improve a fraction of a second
[7698.58s -> 7705.04s]  but anyway so this is what i'm saying that these concepts of uh of of the glyco of a glycolytic
[7705.04s -> 7707.72s]  capacity uh and high intensity training
[7707.84s -> 7714.62s]  they're necessary but they're not what the elite athletes do and if the elite athletes have the best
[7714.62s -> 7722.22s]  metabolic function of any humans why not try to imitate their philosophy of exercise and so just
[7722.22s -> 7727.40s]  to come back to the frequency duration question i think the answer to the following question is going
[7727.40s -> 7733.60s]  to be the more frequent training sessions but if you compared four training regimens that were four
[7733.60s -> 7737.36s]  hours a week each one of them would be
[7737.84s -> 7745.86s]  four 60 minute sessions one of them would be three 80 minute sessions one of them would be two
[7745.86s -> 7750.92s]  two hour sessions and then one of them would be one four hour session so it's the same total volume
[7750.92s -> 7757.10s]  is it safe and notwithstanding the brain damage of one four hour session is it safe to say that
[7757.10s -> 7763.38s]  the four 60 minute sessions because it's a higher frequency would be the optimal one there i would
[7763.38s -> 7767.64s]  say so i i think from my experience that it might be better because it's the
[7767.84s -> 7773.06s]  frequency it's like it's like if you take a medication right if you take a medication twice
[7773.06s -> 7779.24s]  the dose and only three days a week might not work as well as if you take the right dose every day
[7779.24s -> 7784.88s]  right because at the end of the day we're talking about it the whole exercise is medicine right how
[7784.88s -> 7789.86s]  do we prescribe that you know how what's the dose what what's the frequency i'm assuming that you
[7789.86s -> 7795.44s]  will have to take it as many days as possible right uh so that that would say that it's better
[7795.44s -> 7797.78s]  to to do that that being said obviously
[7797.84s -> 7803.12s]  if you have the weekend and you have the possibility which i don't have to do three hours
[7804.00s -> 7810.16s]  go ahead right um and another thing i wanted to point out is that you know for many people there
[7810.16s -> 7816.40s]  they need that adrenaline right um for training so uh other people don't care right other people
[7816.40s -> 7821.36s]  say wow i love this i don't like to kill myself into high intensity but i think you need to do
[7821.36s -> 7826.16s]  some high intensity yeah so i want to talk about that so how do we bring in the other energy systems
[7826.16s -> 7827.68s]  of the of the four
[7827.84s -> 7836.18s]  pillars of exercise in my world uh stability strength low end aerobic which i describe really
[7836.18s -> 7840.86s]  as like talk about this kind of mitochondrial efficiency and then high end aerobic which is
[7840.86s -> 7847.52s]  peak aerobic capacity slash anaerobic performance so anaerobic power peak aerobic
[7848.48s -> 7856.00s]  low end aerobic mitochondrial efficiency strength stability of those four i for some reason struggle
[7856.00s -> 7857.66s]  to make the time
[7857.84s -> 7865.88s]  the peak aerobic in part because I, one, it's the least enjoyable truth. If we're going to be
[7865.88s -> 7871.06s]  brutally honest, if you're doing it right, it hurts the most. It's also no longer as relevant
[7871.06s -> 7875.48s]  because I don't compete at anything, right? Like it was, I actually really enjoyed that type of
[7875.48s -> 7880.92s]  training when I competed because you have to spend time in that energy system and you see the rewards
[7880.92s -> 7887.30s]  of, you know, repeating 60 minute, you know, re you know, 60 minutes of repeating two minute
[7887.30s -> 7892.10s]  intervals or something like that. So if we're, if we're really talking about this from the lens
[7892.10s -> 7900.82s]  of health, maximizing health, the data are unambiguous that VO two max is highly correlated
[7900.82s -> 7907.08s]  with longevity in a, in a, unlike there are not many variables that are more strongly correlated.
[7908.34s -> 7911.76s]  So, but the levels don't have to be that high, right? We're not, I mean,
[7911.76s -> 7917.28s]  Pogacar's VO two max is probably 85, you know, or it's probably in the eighties at least,
[7917.30s -> 7925.38s]  in terms of a milliliters per minute per kilogram, but someone my age to be considered
[7925.38s -> 7931.94s]  absolutely elite, which means the top 2.5 to 2.7% of the population, which carries with it
[7931.94s -> 7939.44s]  a five fold reduction in risk to the bottom 25% of the population. Uh, my VO two max requirement
[7939.44s -> 7947.02s]  is about 52, 53 milliliters per minute per kilogram. So the question is,
[7947.30s -> 7953.36s]  can I use that as the gauge for how much high intensity training I need to do basically just
[7953.36s -> 7958.46s]  enough to make sure I maintain that VO two max, or do you think about it in a different way?
[7958.46s -> 7963.94s]  Well, I think about it more again, the bioenergetics energy, energy systems, right? I
[7963.94s -> 7971.18s]  think that, uh, ultimately, and we know that, um, longevity is also high related with mitochondrial
[7971.18s -> 7977.18s]  function and metabolic health. I think that more and more, and, and, and this is what you see in
[7977.18s -> 7983.54s]  so many fields in, in, in medicine nowadays, right? That everybody's is stumbling upon mitochondria,
[7983.54s -> 7989.06s]  right? Um, um, and, and so there's an aging process where we lose mitochondrial function,
[7989.06s -> 7995.66s]  uh, and there's like a sedentary, um, a component, right? Where we lose mitochondrial function. Um,
[7995.66s -> 8000.82s]  I wish that we could have a medication appeal that you could take it and increase the mitochondrial
[8000.82s -> 8005.74s]  function because it would increase metabolic health and longevity. But the only medication
[8005.74s -> 8006.88s]  that we know is exercise.
[8007.18s -> 8013.12s]  And the medic and within exercise that the right, the dose that we see that improves the most and,
[8013.12s -> 8017.62s]  and also is sustainable in the long term, which is another important concept, you know,
[8017.62s -> 8023.56s]  uh, very high intensity training is not sustainable. Very extreme diets are not
[8023.56s -> 8027.94s]  sustainable. If you combine both, it's even worse. And this is what a lot of people are
[8027.94s -> 8032.74s]  doing together, but you need to have some sustainability, but this is what we've seen.
[8032.74s -> 8035.92s]  This is important to improve that mitochondrial function,
[8035.92s -> 8037.12s]  but going back to,
[8037.18s -> 8042.64s]  to that, that high intensity, I think is necessary because we also lose glycolytic capacity as we age.
[8042.64s -> 8047.32s]  And it's important to stimulate it. As you very well said for all of us, we're not competing.
[8047.32s -> 8053.68s]  I couldn't care less about, um, um, being super high intensity, uh, because I'm not competing.
[8053.68s -> 8058.48s]  Uh, but that said, I want to have also my adrenaline rush, you know? So, uh, like many
[8058.48s -> 8063.16s]  people, I, but how much does it feed into it? So for example, if, and I've often thought about
[8063.16s -> 8067.12s]  this now, as I just want to make sure my zone two is above three Watts per.
[8067.18s -> 8072.88s]  Kilo, would I be better off taking that extra training? If I have one additional training
[8072.88s -> 8079.12s]  session per week, should I make it an additional zone to workout? So then I do four now, should I
[8079.12s -> 8086.62s]  be doing a fifth one or should I be taking that fifth one and doing a VO two max protocol? And
[8086.62s -> 8090.46s]  that's, that's what we'll typically prescribe to our patients is a four by four protocol of,
[8090.46s -> 8096.40s]  you know, highest intensity sustained for four minutes, followed by four minutes of recovery and,
[8096.40s -> 8097.16s]  and then repeat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8097.18s -> 8101.68s]  Yeah. Or you can repeat that four or five, six times. Uh, you know, when you put that, when you
[8101.68s -> 8105.34s]  put a warm up and cool down on either end of that, you know, that's a little over an hour.
[8106.36s -> 8110.86s]  So you could, would you spend that hour doing that in an effort to make
[8110.86s -> 8115.72s]  your zone two even better? Or would you just do an extra hour of zone two?
[8115.72s -> 8121.22s]  No, that's a really good question. So what, what, I, what I, I, I, I agree. I agree that,
[8121.54s -> 8126.34s]  uh, you can, if you have a fifth day, you can convert it into any type of high intensity
[8126.34s -> 8126.76s]  Okay.
[8126.76s -> 8127.16s]  Session.
[8127.16s -> 8131.66s]  structured all right what I can tell people so hey if you're a cyclist or a
[8131.66s -> 8134.96s]  runner and you want to go with your friends that's your group ride yeah
[8134.96s -> 8140.48s]  everybody go ahead and boom go at it or or if you don't have a possibility what
[8140.48s -> 8145.34s]  this is my situation for example where I don't have the time to train more than
[8145.34s -> 8149.40s]  an hour and a half usually two hours max right so what I do almost on every
[8149.40s -> 8155.72s]  session I do my zone two so it's clean and at the end that's what I do a very
[8155.72s -> 8160.76s]  high intensity interval and tell me the duration so if you do our of zone two
[8160.76s -> 8165.72s]  yeah so I do usually let's say an hour and a half right so and so you'll do an
[8165.72s -> 8170.06s]  hour and a half of zone two three or four times a week yeah I try I shoot for
[8170.06s -> 8175.28s]  four or five but not have all the time is easy but yeah I should for five and
[8175.28s -> 8179.84s]  try to be strict on that but let's say that yeah the last and unfortunately
[8179.84s -> 8184.48s]  that you know I where I live you know like I leave it more enough it's
[8184.48s -> 8185.36s]  Highlands area
[8185.72s -> 8191.54s]  and uh so you have to go up so the last part I just I just go at it you know
[8191.54s -> 8195.26s]  sometimes you you find another cyclist and you just compete you know to see
[8195.26s -> 8199.88s]  who's the the fastest in that short climb but I try to do like a good five
[8199.88s -> 8204.86s]  minute interval roughly um uh where I really like kind of like I go hard at it
[8204.86s -> 8211.28s]  and and an array of I arrive home like man I kicked my ass today or this kicked
[8211.28s -> 8215.30s]  my ass today or or sometimes you try it and you don't have the energy as I
[8215.72s -> 8217.36s]  go home
[8217.36s -> 8220.72s]  I can't even move my foot I feel like oh my gosh I can barely move the pedals
[8220.72s -> 8226.88s]  today that's just quit and go home but when I feel fresh you know that's what I
[8226.88s -> 8231.66s]  stimulate that glyocalyptic system what we know well too is that you know that
[8231.66s -> 8236.04s]  increases the mitochondrial function it takes months or years increasing the
[8236.04s -> 8243.44s]  glycolic system it takes much much less amount of time you can do that in weeks
[8243.44s -> 8245.56s]  or months and you can just if you stimulate on a regular base two days a week or three days the SH is a long amount of time it takes to wake
[8245.72s -> 8251.96s]  days a week at the end of that zone two. That's where you can target both energy systems,
[8251.96s -> 8255.16s]  right? The oxidative mitochondrial system and the glycolytic.
[8255.16s -> 8261.88s]  And we don't blunt it. We don't blunt the benefit we had from the zone two if we
[8261.88s -> 8265.72s]  immediately follow it with the zone five. No. No, because that's done, right?
[8265.72s -> 8266.28s]  Yeah. Okay.
[8266.28s -> 8269.24s]  That's not... What I see is like if you do the same things in the middle-
[8269.24s -> 8270.76s]  But you don't want to do the reverse order.
[8271.64s -> 8272.44s]  Yes. And one of the things-
[8272.44s -> 8273.96s]  You don't want to start with the high intensity.
[8273.96s -> 8278.04s]  Exactly. One of the things, because you start having all these hormonal responses and also
[8278.04s -> 8282.36s]  you see you have high lactate levels in the blood and what we know very well is like lactate
[8282.36s -> 8289.16s]  inhibits lipolysis. So if you have a high interval in the middle or the beginning and you don't clear
[8289.16s -> 8294.92s]  lactate very well, you might have high lactate levels for a while and it's going to inhibit
[8294.92s -> 8302.04s]  lipolysis, right? Also another study we have under review, lactate at the autocrine level
[8303.00s -> 8303.72s]  decreases
[8303.96s -> 8310.76s]  the activity of CPT-1 and CPT-2. So it interferes with the transport of fatty acids as well.
[8311.64s -> 8316.60s]  So that's where like if you do all these, you might change things. You have high corticulinemia
[8316.60s -> 8317.00s]  as well.
[8317.00s -> 8321.16s]  And that's an important point. I'm glad you raised that because I explain this to patients
[8321.16s -> 8329.08s]  when they say, I went out and did a two-hour ride today and it showed me that I spent 45
[8329.08s -> 8333.96s]  of those minutes, 45 of those 120 minutes were in zone two. So I did 45 minutes of zone two and I
[8333.96s -> 8338.28s]  said, no, you didn't really do it because you were going up and down and up and down and up and down.
[8338.28s -> 8343.80s]  And so that's not the same as spending 45 minutes in the dedicated energy system.
[8343.80s -> 8348.12s]  You're right. And if you, I mean, when I look at the training peaks, you know, like you see the
[8348.12s -> 8353.64s]  elite athletes, they're like more power output and heart rate. This is like goes together.
[8354.28s -> 8358.36s]  Incredible. You know, whereas yeah, you're right. You're up and down and down. The average might
[8358.36s -> 8362.60s]  be in zone two, but actually you're between oscillating zone one, zone three, zone four all
[8362.60s -> 8363.90s]  the time. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8363.96s -> 8368.76s]  So tell me what's the difference between, so, so if you don't mind sharing, what is your, in Watts
[8368.76s -> 8375.80s]  per kilo, what is your zone two in Colorado where you're at altitude? Yeah. So I, I usually go and,
[8375.80s -> 8380.76s]  and I'm, I'm, I, I'm not very good at, uh, at, you know, like I understand, I mean doing this,
[8380.76s -> 8388.28s]  but I'm, it depends. Uh, um, uh, what I'm saying is like, I don't look so much into this. I have
[8388.28s -> 8393.88s]  done so many, uh, tests in my life. I, I was, since I was 15 years old,
[8393.96s -> 8401.40s]  I was using a heart rate monitor. I'm talking about 1986. Um, um, when the first card monitors
[8401.40s -> 8405.40s]  came out. So in other words, you're, what you're getting at is you don't like to have a lot of data
[8405.40s -> 8410.32s]  when you're doing it. You're going off RPE and you're not looking at your power meter or a heart
[8410.32s -> 8414.50s]  rate monitor and you're not poking your finger when you're done. I do it here and there, you
[8414.50s -> 8418.76s]  know, cause I still want to look at this and I do a metabolic testing here and there. Right. Uh,
[8418.76s -> 8423.92s]  but I've done so much on me since I was 15 years old and I was obsessed by,
[8423.96s -> 8430.50s]  by this. Now I, I, I got to a point that I know my, my, my, my body quite well, uh, where I,
[8430.50s -> 8435.28s]  I, I can just go by the sensations and, and, um, and, but here and there I double check.
[8435.28s -> 8440.66s]  But it's hard for you to then get at what I've observed. The few times I've tried to do my zone
[8440.66s -> 8447.26s]  to at altitude, like in Colorado, it's a enormous discount. I feel like it's a 20%
[8447.26s -> 8453.74s]  discount at altitude. Yeah. I tried to go like around, yeah, mine's around 2.5, 2.8,
[8453.82s -> 8453.94s]  something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8453.94s -> 8459.56s]  Something like that. Watts per kilogram. Uh, when, when I, when I do it, um, and I, you know,
[8459.56s -> 8465.64s]  like about one, two. So at sea level, at sea level, you'd be over three probably based on
[8465.64s -> 8471.00s]  what I experienced going in the reverse direction. Yeah. Yeah. I would say roughly. Um, uh, and,
[8471.10s -> 8477.30s]  and one thing that I'm very proud of, uh, is that, um, I have been doing, cause I do sporadically
[8477.30s -> 8482.52s]  this testing. I, I know my PRs cause I think we have climbs here and one day I go, I'm going to
[8482.52s -> 8483.48s]  go for this climb.
[8483.48s -> 8492.02s]  And I go full out on that climb. Right. And I'm 50 now. Uh, and I have the same, uh, uh, uh,
[8492.02s -> 8498.08s]  metabolic parameters that when I was 40. So, um, to me, I'm very proud of, of these because
[8498.08s -> 8503.16s]  when you say parameters, you don't mean times up the climbs, which parameters are the same.
[8503.26s -> 8510.06s]  Yes. So I look at, you know, lactating power output. Okay. I look at a VO two. I look at,
[8510.06s -> 8513.46s]  uh, time as well. You know, the PR that I had, it was,
[8513.48s -> 8516.28s]  it was similar. In fact, the other day I beat my PR.
[8516.48s -> 8518.02s]  What's your VO two max now?
[8518.64s -> 8526.22s]  So my VO two max now is, uh, four liters, um, um, uh, per minute, you know, so that's about 51,
[8526.22s -> 8532.72s]  52. Okay. Well, that's, I am, but you could easily, you could easily raise that if you
[8532.72s -> 8536.70s]  lost, you know, three kilos, which you could probably do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[8536.70s -> 8543.46s]  And the thing is, because I've obviously, when I was a cyclist, uh, I was 141, 143 pounds.
[8543.48s -> 8547.38s]  And you were probably, your VO two was five and a half liters or something.
[8547.58s -> 8556.30s]  It was, it was 76.7. Uh, so that's, um, uh, let me see. It was 4.5, I believe between, uh, 65.
[8557.14s -> 8564.82s]  Yeah, it was, it was about, uh, 4.8, something like that. Uh, so now, you know, like 40 years
[8564.82s -> 8572.26s]  later, 30 years later, right. Uh, I have decreased only about 0.5, 0.7. Right. Which, whoa, I'm really
[8572.64s -> 8573.46s]  happy about that.
[8573.48s -> 8579.04s]  Because I'm not training like I did. Uh, um, but this is one of the parameters, but in a decade,
[8579.04s -> 8586.04s]  I haven't decreased my parameters. So this is to me, it's a proving point to myself, at least that
[8586.04s -> 8593.44s]  doing this routine, um, it, it, it, it helps, uh, to maintain, you know, that metabolic health
[8593.44s -> 8600.68s]  that you had a decade ago. Now, can you do this 10 more years? And when I turned 60, uh, I don't
[8600.68s -> 8603.46s]  know. But what I know is that from other people, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[8603.48s -> 8610.26s]  know. I'm seeing it. So I see the typical person who just retired or, or as we, as I discussed
[8610.26s -> 8617.06s]  earlier, aspire to pre-retire at the age of 60 or a little bit before in the moment they, uh, and
[8617.06s -> 8622.12s]  these are like people like us, we are struggling to, to, to squeeze in time, you know, and do five
[8622.12s -> 8628.86s]  hours a year, six hours a week here or 10 at max. Um, but then they have the whole time in the world
[8628.86s -> 8633.46s]  and they can sleep in. They don't have, or they're not sleeping. They don't have, they're not sleeping.
[8633.48s -> 8639.70s]  They're not overworked. Uh, you know, and they can exercise. It's unbelievable and super
[8639.70s -> 8647.02s]  inspiring how much they improve in their sixties. I've seen people in their seventies with the
[8647.02s -> 8655.00s]  metabolic parameters of, of, of people active, morally active, uh, in their thirties. I saw
[8655.00s -> 8661.90s]  the world champion in the cycling who's 81 in the category of 80 to 85. Believe me, there's a
[8661.90s -> 8662.96s]  category of that.
[8663.48s -> 8669.32s]  Uh, whose metabolic parameters were those of someone in their thirties, healthy, active. So
[8669.32s -> 8676.24s]  this is incredibly inspiring. Then I think that we're rewriting what's been taught to us in the
[8676.24s -> 8681.86s]  books. Now, in fairness was, was that person of an elite athlete? Were they a professional athlete
[8681.86s -> 8687.64s]  in their twenties and thirties? Never. And this is what struck me. He was a smoker,
[8688.36s -> 8693.06s]  hypertensive, and he started cycling because he needed to change his lifestyle.
[8693.48s -> 8697.94s]  In his forties. Cause that's the same question. Like, wow, you must be doing this all your life.
[8697.96s -> 8702.86s]  Like, no, I started riding my bike when I was in my forties. I was a smoker. I was heavy. I was
[8702.86s -> 8710.72s]  hypertensive. Like what? So it's incredible that 40 years later, he's in a better health.
[8711.64s -> 8716.94s]  But, but I'll tell you what I, what I take away from that as well is the benefits and the more,
[8716.94s -> 8722.12s]  the importance of compounding. You see, you alluded to it earlier, and I think the listener
[8722.12s -> 8723.24s]  could be forgiven.
[8723.48s -> 8729.54s]  They missed this point. You can make relatively quick changes in your glycolytic efficiency.
[8729.54s -> 8739.92s]  You can, you can take an untrained person with a VO two max of 20 mils per mig per minute or
[8739.92s -> 8746.80s]  makes a mil per gig per minute. And you could take them from 20 to 30 in a period of months
[8746.80s -> 8752.28s]  with the right amount of training, a 50% improvement in a few months.
[8752.52s -> 8753.00s]  Exactly.
[8753.48s -> 8759.34s]  Very difficult to see a 50% improvement in mitochondrial function in a few months.
[8759.54s -> 8759.94s]  Exactly.
[8760.04s -> 8763.26s]  And, and, and you, you've already made this point, but I just want to restate it because
[8763.26s -> 8770.08s]  it's important to set expectations. And it speaks to why this level of training should be thought
[8770.08s -> 8775.90s]  of in the same way that you think of accumulating wealth, which is you got to, it's, it's day in
[8775.90s -> 8783.36s]  and day out, day in and day out, small compounded gains over years and years and
[8783.36s -> 8783.46s]  years.
[8783.48s -> 8792.28s]  Is why a 40 year old overweight smoker can become a world champion at 80. It's because he probably
[8792.28s -> 8795.68s]  never once again got out of shape in that 40 years.
[8796.12s -> 8800.28s]  Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. And this is incredibly inspiring. You know,
[8800.30s -> 8805.76s]  when I see these people in their sixties, just retired and they come to do their first test
[8805.76s -> 8811.68s]  and one year later they come back. I mean, it gives me the goosebumps because it is like,
[8811.68s -> 8813.44s]  Oh my gosh, like,
[8813.48s -> 8820.80s]  how can you improve so much? And they're, they're like, and they're like, look, I'm, I'm 64 and I feel
[8820.80s -> 8827.52s]  strong as, as when I was in my thirties, you know, and like, Oh, and so this is where we're going to
[8827.52s -> 8835.44s]  be, you know, like, and of course no medications, you know, um, really good state of mind, uh, which
[8835.44s -> 8841.72s]  is absolutely key for longevity, right? Um, normal diet. They can, they're not strictly one days or
[8841.72s -> 8842.72s]  not that they, they,
[8842.72s -> 8848.92s]  they eat in moderation, but they can have a little bit of everything, right? Uh, which is also in my
[8848.92s -> 8855.00s]  modest opinion is part of the enjoyment of life, um, um, eating what you like in moderation as
[8855.00s -> 8860.52s]  well. Um, so it's an incredibly inspiring to see all these examples and, and, and, and a way where
[8860.52s -> 8865.92s]  we're rewriting, but we've been, been thought for years that once you turn 40, everything is going
[8865.92s -> 8871.76s]  down. You can really, really change. And again, you know, you're, you know, you're, you're, you
[8871.76s -> 8872.70s]  own, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,
[8872.72s -> 8874.04s]  you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,
[8874.04s -> 8877.60s]  you can really, you know, take ownership of that and improve it at any age.
[8877.60s -> 8881.32s]  So what you mentioned drugs, I want to talk about one drug in particular and maybe some
[8881.32s -> 8887.36s]  supplements. Um, you and I have spoken so much about this and, you know, myself and another
[8887.36s -> 8894.34s]  person are committed to funding a study that we're going to be doing once the, um, uh, once
[8894.34s -> 8901.84s]  we get through kind of the backlog of, of COVID, uh, issues at the university. Um, but, uh,
[8902.72s -> 8909.10s]  The question really arises around the use of metformin and whether or not there's sort of
[8909.10s -> 8915.18s]  a true impairment of mitochondrial function or whether the elevated lactate levels we see
[8915.18s -> 8921.10s]  in patients taking metformin is an artifact of the drug itself, but says nothing of the
[8921.10s -> 8926.54s]  mitochondrial function. Do you have any more insight into this question that we struggle
[8926.54s -> 8933.22s]  with greatly? Because we have some patients who take metformin who receive much benefit
[8933.22s -> 8940.68s]  from taking metformin, but it makes it confusing to interpret their zone two data. And it makes
[8940.68s -> 8945.76s]  me ask the question, you know, it's a more important, in those patients, it's maybe less
[8945.76s -> 8950.36s]  relevant, but now it becomes relevant when we think about using metformin as a geroprotective
[8950.36s -> 8956.52s]  agent, an agent to enhance longevity. Yeah. That's a thing that we need a lot
[8956.52s -> 8964.66s]  of research on that, I think, to understand this better. Now, it's strange that it definitely
[8964.66s -> 8969.82s]  seems to work in many patients, right? Obviously, for those ones in the pre-diabetic, first
[8969.82s -> 8976.96s]  stage diabetes, it's a very good medication. It's been used for a long time with good results.
[8976.96s -> 8984.54s]  But how about the long-term results, right? We know that metformin inhibits complex one,
[8984.54s -> 8986.32s]  which is key for mitochondrial function.
[8986.32s -> 8986.52s]  Yeah.
[8986.52s -> 8993.90s]  In the electron transport chain. So, we don't know the long-term effects of metformin, right?
[8995.16s -> 9001.78s]  In longevity, this is where I think that we need more information as well. We see, or
[9001.78s -> 9008.30s]  I see, like, someone showing up with lactate of 3.5 millimoles at rest. And the first thing
[9008.30s -> 9012.64s]  I ask is like, are you on metformin? And many times they say yes. And I'm sure you see the
[9012.64s -> 9016.32s]  same thing, right? Like, wow. So, it's definitely...
[9016.32s -> 9017.32s]  Yeah.
[9017.32s -> 9018.32s]  So, if you're on lactate of 3.5 millimoles or 3 millimoles of lactate, why do you see
[9018.32s -> 9022.18s]  at rest 3.5 millimoles or 3 millimoles of lactate?
[9022.18s -> 9029.04s]  And by the way, is there fat oxidation commensurately suppressed? Because when you metabolically
[9029.04s -> 9036.16s]  test them on the cart, do you see in that individual a very, very low fat oxidation?
[9036.16s -> 9042.32s]  If not, it might suggest that that lactate level of 2 or 3 millimole is an artifact,
[9042.32s -> 9044.96s]  but doesn't really speak to what's happening in the mitochondria, right?
[9044.96s -> 9046.12s]  Yes. And that's a great question. I mean, I think that's a great question. I mean, I'm
[9046.12s -> 9055.28s]  not sure. I mean, I haven't seen people taking metformin as a medication, you know, for longevity,
[9055.28s -> 9059.30s]  for example, or for health. What I see people on metformin are already clinical patients.
[9059.30s -> 9062.62s]  Yeah. So, in other words, it's confound... So, of course, they're low because...
[9062.62s -> 9066.98s]  Yeah. So, they're taking metformin in the first place because of their clinical condition,
[9066.98s -> 9072.90s]  which is driven by a mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction. So, it's difficult to discern,
[9072.90s -> 9074.12s]  but I mean, I'm sure you have more experience of people taking metformin.
[9074.12s -> 9075.12s]  Yeah.
[9075.12s -> 9076.12s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[9076.12s -> 9077.12s]  Yeah. Yeah.
[9077.12s -> 9078.12s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[9078.12s -> 9079.12s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[9079.12s -> 9080.12s]  We do. But...
[9080.12s -> 9082.36s]  Yeah. But that's why this study that we're eventually going to get around to doing is
[9082.36s -> 9085.62s]  going to be so important because it will answer this question directly.
[9085.62s -> 9091.54s]  Yeah. And we can do it with the muscle biopsies. And as you say, does it really mess up with
[9091.54s -> 9098.44s]  the whole mitochondrial function or can even like the mitochondrial function overall overwrite
[9098.44s -> 9104.32s]  that inhibition of complex I and overwrite other pathways? I don't think we know the
[9104.32s -> 9105.32s]  answer to that.
[9105.32s -> 9108.16s]  Do you have an insight into any other supplements?
[9108.16s -> 9115.32s]  There's no shortage of supplements that are out there that are touted as sort of, you
[9115.32s -> 9119.68s]  know, longevity boosting agents and mitochondrial health agents.
[9119.92s -> 9124.88s]  So the most talked about of all of these, I think, is the precursors to NAD.
[9125.74s -> 9133.40s]  So the most common of these would be NR or NMN, both of which are pretty clear that they
[9133.40s -> 9135.24s]  are precursors to NAD.
[9135.24s -> 9139.06s]  There's certainly some debate about how clinically relevant it is.
[9139.32s -> 9147.24s]  Do you have a point of view on whether or not taking a supplement that boosts NAD, at
[9147.24s -> 9148.76s]  least in the plasma?
[9149.04s -> 9154.46s]  I still don't know how well it's boosting NAD in the cell, but nevertheless, do you
[9154.46s -> 9160.28s]  have a sense of if that is beneficial to the mitochondria, both theoretically, but more
[9160.28s -> 9161.38s]  importantly, experimentally?
[9161.38s -> 9163.38s]  Yeah, well, that's...
[9163.38s -> 9164.22s]  That's a great point.
[9164.22s -> 9168.02s]  And this is like, I don't think we have the answer, but I think we need to be cautious
[9168.02s -> 9170.96s]  about how we interpret this data.
[9171.90s -> 9178.22s]  It's definitely been shown multiple times that NAD levels at the cellular level or even
[9178.22s -> 9180.80s]  mitochondrial level are decreased with aging, right?
[9181.28s -> 9184.28s]  Therefore, the whole thing, well, if it's low, let's take it, right?
[9184.58s -> 9186.42s]  But it's not only NAD.
[9187.24s -> 9192.72s]  I mean, if you look at so many metabolites, you know, at the cellular level and mitochondrial
[9192.72s -> 9193.12s]  level.
[9193.38s -> 9195.46s]  They're down-regulated with aging, right?
[9195.58s -> 9198.66s]  The question is, why are they down-regulated?
[9199.38s -> 9205.24s]  It's because mitochondria, per se, to start out with, is down-regulated, so it doesn't
[9205.24s -> 9207.94s]  need so much NAD because it cannot take it, right?
[9208.48s -> 9211.58s]  Or other supplements or other metabolites, right?
[9211.84s -> 9218.94s]  So this is at least how I think of NAD, as we mentioned earlier, it's very important
[9218.94s -> 9222.66s]  in glycolysis and redox status, right?
[9222.76s -> 9223.24s]  To maintain redox.
[9223.38s -> 9231.36s]  And it's very important in glyceryl-3-phosphate to 2,3-biphosphoglycerate phosphate, where
[9231.36s -> 9239.96s]  NAD is utilized to convert glyceryl-3-phosphate to 2,3-phosphoglycerate, but it's depleted.
[9240.58s -> 9244.12s]  And this is why the only thing that rescues that is lactate, right, as we mentioned.
[9244.26s -> 9247.28s]  Now, taking NAD, is that going to increase longevity?
[9247.70s -> 9248.88s]  I don't think so.
[9248.88s -> 9253.38s]  That's my opinion, because longevity is not just one supplement or two or three.
[9253.38s -> 9254.22s]  Or four or five.
[9254.64s -> 9258.62s]  It's a compendium on an incredible amount of things that happen at the cellular level.
[9258.62s -> 9260.76s]  And I don't think that one supplement.
[9260.76s -> 9265.94s]  I remember those days where resveratrol was the thing, right, for longevity.
[9266.26s -> 9269.52s]  And everybody was, not everybody, a lot of people were buying resveratrol.
[9269.52s -> 9274.14s]  And there are studies with mice showing that increased 50% longevity in mice.
[9274.14s -> 9275.52s]  So there are four that do it in humans.
[9275.90s -> 9279.88s]  Well, as you probably know, a lot of people started taking resveratrol when
[9279.88s -> 9282.44s]  they were 50 and they're dead now, you know?
[9282.50s -> 9283.38s]  It did increase.
[9283.38s -> 9285.78s]  It doesn't increase longevity in humans, right?
[9286.06s -> 9286.32s]  Yeah.
[9286.32s -> 9290.98s]  I mean, and I think, you know, I think the data in the mice, we can debate the merits of that.
[9291.30s -> 9293.04s]  I want to ask you about a theoretical risk though.
[9293.04s -> 9294.30s]  You kind of alluded to it.
[9295.20s -> 9299.90s]  Isn't there a scenario under which too much NAD could be harmful?
[9300.18s -> 9305.70s]  If you had an existing, if you took, I don't know if this study has been done, but if you took cancer
[9305.70s -> 9312.94s]  patients or patients who had tumors that were undiagnosed and gave them, if you boost, if you doubled their
[9312.94s -> 9313.32s]  NAD.
[9313.38s -> 9318.78s]  Levels, wouldn't you actually favor the tumor's metabolism?
[9318.90s -> 9322.44s]  Well, in fact, we have done that pilot study with mice.
[9323.10s -> 9328.86s]  So the whole thing is like looking at in my area of research in cancer is cancer metabolism, right?
[9328.86s -> 9329.10s]  Yeah.
[9329.22s -> 9332.52s]  And we know that glycolysis is key for cancer.
[9333.24s -> 9340.74s]  And NAD is absolutely indispensable to feed that glycolysis, as I mean, as we have alluded a few times.
[9340.74s -> 9341.04s]  Right.
[9341.30s -> 9343.26s]  So the question is like.
[9343.26s -> 9355.50s]  As you say, would NAD increase that glycolytic rate or glycolytic flux, therefore, would be favoring more cancer phenotype?
[9356.64s -> 9359.50s]  So what we did, we haven't published that.
[9359.50s -> 9362.02s]  It's a pilot study, which is we're curious about it.
[9362.02s -> 9363.66s]  And we had a few mice.
[9363.96s -> 9367.62s]  We have an NLF8 mice, four in four.
[9367.86s -> 9370.98s]  So what we did is we transfected tumors.
[9370.98s -> 9372.78s]  We had triple negative breast cancer.
[9372.78s -> 9375.30s]  It's very aggressive and it grows very, very fast.
[9375.90s -> 9387.74s]  And so one group, we give them just water and the other group, we give them nicotinamide riboside, which is the NAD precursor.
[9388.26s -> 9390.34s]  Because NAD, obviously, as you know, you cannot take it.
[9390.34s -> 9391.62s]  You need to take the precursor.
[9391.98s -> 9402.06s]  And we observed the tumor growth over 23 days after that, the IRB at the university, because you cannot have animals with
[9402.06s -> 9403.62s]  with that with high tumors.
[9403.62s -> 9407.82s]  Right. So it was a flank tumor and you need to harvest them.
[9408.06s -> 9419.82s]  So after and we were measuring, you know, every five days, the tumor growth and we saw in these animals that there was about 15% increase in tumor growth in the NAD group.
[9420.66s -> 9426.72s]  So again, and you saw that difference with only four mice in each group.
[9426.72s -> 9432.02s]  Yes, it's four in four, but but but all consistent, you know, we have statistic.
[9432.06s -> 9437.76s]  The significance, even with the small four, I mean, there was no cross results.
[9438.06s -> 9445.08s]  All the four mice, they grew cancer at a higher rate than in the NAD, than the control group.
[9445.44s -> 9451.38s]  Again, that's why, like, obviously, this is not like a publishable because we need more.
[9451.50s -> 9457.50s]  Is that a study you'll you'll repeat at a sufficiently powered size?
[9457.78s -> 9462.06s]  I would love to. And this is this is why we just did this pilot study we had because we have.
[9462.06s -> 9468.68s]  Many minds and say, hey, let's let's let's give it a shot and let's see because there's a lot of hype of the NAD and and we saw this.
[9468.68s -> 9491.10s]  So we would love to do it at a much higher level because my question, which might be a disruptive question, is like, you know, what if you have a small tumor that you're unaware of, like in the pancreas or in the colon or in the lung, could NAD over time, day after day after day, could favor that tumor growth?
[9491.10s -> 9491.44s]  Right.
[9492.06s -> 9495.14s]  Like lytic flux to that tumor and increase the growth.
[9495.14s -> 9502.64s]  In the literature, I've never looked because it just kind of occurred to me when you had that slide up earlier, earlier and you showed the mitochondrial slide.
[9503.20s -> 9506.72s]  It occurred to me that you have that lactate escape from the tumor.
[9506.94s -> 9511.06s]  Hey, this would feed it. But has anybody in the literature examined this question?
[9511.16s -> 9516.16s]  It seems like a very common it seems like a reasonable question to ask.
[9516.56s -> 9518.16s]  Yeah, there are a couple of studies.
[9518.16s -> 9522.00s]  I think once a review is more of the conceptual.
[9522.10s -> 9523.10s]  Level right.
[9523.10s -> 9546.90s]  And this is what got me thinking like, yeah, this is this is something that for us working in cancer metabolism, we look into this right looking like, you know, like, obviously, one of the things that we have shown is that lactate is an onco metabolite lactate it we have shown we have a first paper and we have like a like a good six, seven papers more to come.
[9547.30s -> 9550.20s]  We've been working hard for three years looking into this.
[9550.62s -> 9551.90s]  But we saw that lactate regulates.
[9552.06s -> 9582.04s]  The genetic expression of the most important genes in breast cancer, we're seeing the same thing now with lung cancer and lactate as we keep talking about this is that is the mandatory byproduct of glycolysis and as Warburg saw in 1923, the characteristic of cancer cells with most cancer cells is the high glycolytic flux, but what struck Warburg was not the glucose itself was the lactate production.
[9582.06s -> 9585.06s]  So anyways, we are showing that is an onco metabolite.
[9585.06s -> 9599.06s]  So if you if you have a high glycolytic rate in a cell, you're going to produce a lot of lactate, right, if you cannot clear that lactate, it's going to drive self growth and proliferation as we're seeing.
[9599.06s -> 9610.06s]  And in fact, we're now blocking lactate production, both through genetic engineering as well as DCA, for example, and we're seeing that cancer growth and proliferation.
[9610.06s -> 9611.06s]  And we're seeing that cancer growth and proliferation.
[9611.06s -> 9612.06s]  And we're seeing that cancer growth and proliferation.
[9612.06s -> 9615.06s]  Completely stops within hours.
[9615.06s -> 9629.06s]  So now that poses an interesting dilemma, right, which is exercise would increase your capacity for clearing lactate in the long term, but in the short term raises lactate.
[9629.06s -> 9635.06s]  So it begs the question in a cancer patient specifically, what's the net impact of exercise?
[9635.06s -> 9641.06s]  Yeah. So this is what we're working on that the hypothesis, you know, my colleague, George Brooks.
[9641.06s -> 9653.06s]  So he's shown that acute response to lactate, it increases overexpression about 600 something genes.
[9653.06s -> 9655.06s]  I forgot right now. Right.
[9655.06s -> 9660.06s]  All these genes are involved in cellular homeostasis and in the benefits of exercise.
[9660.06s -> 9666.06s]  Right. So we know very, very well through his work that lactate is a signaling molecule.
[9666.06s -> 9670.06s]  Now, the question is, like, we know this at an acute exposure, which is exercise.
[9670.06s -> 9674.06s]  You do exercise, boom, boom, boom, you're out.
[9674.06s -> 9677.06s]  But cancer doesn't do that.
[9677.06s -> 9681.06s]  Cancer accumulates lactate and it keeps accumulating.
[9681.06s -> 9686.06s]  And this is the main responsible for the tumor microenvironment, which is acidic.
[9686.06s -> 9695.06s]  And the more acidic the tumor microenvironment, the more metastatic the cancer is and the more aggressive, like the more glycolytic the tumor is.
[9695.06s -> 9697.06s]  And this is very well documented.
[9697.06s -> 9699.06s]  The more glycolytic the tumor is, the more aggressive it is.
[9699.06s -> 9706.06s]  And the more lactogenic, that is more lactate the tumor produces, the more aggressive it is.
[9706.06s -> 9709.06s]  Now, why is that lactate accumulating?
[9709.06s -> 9711.06s]  That's what we need to try to find out.
[9711.06s -> 9714.06s]  But we know that that is not acute anymore.
[9714.06s -> 9717.06s]  It's chronic exposure to lactate.
[9717.06s -> 9720.06s]  So can exercise counteract that?
[9720.06s -> 9726.06s]  Right. When we see that exercise might be beneficial for many patients.
[9726.06s -> 9728.06s]  But again, going back to the right intensity.
[9728.06s -> 9733.06s]  We know that the particles which are exosomes, right?
[9733.06s -> 9735.06s]  There are micro vesicles in the body.
[9735.06s -> 9738.06s]  They're main responsible for metastasis.
[9738.06s -> 9740.06s]  We have seen that.
[9740.06s -> 9745.06s]  And this is another publication you're going to have in breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells.
[9745.06s -> 9751.06s]  We are looking at the protein content and the micro ironase of those exosomes released by these cancer cells.
[9751.06s -> 9755.06s]  It's incredible the information that they have there.
[9755.06s -> 9757.06s]  If you were to genetically engineer.
[9757.06s -> 9767.06s]  A molecule that can be injected into a tissue and transformed into cancer.
[9767.06s -> 9770.06s]  You would replicate an exosome.
[9770.06s -> 9772.06s]  It has all the components needed.
[9772.06s -> 9776.06s]  On the other side, muscles also release exosomes.
[9776.06s -> 9782.06s]  And this could be one of the benefits of exercise as an organ.
[9782.06s -> 9786.06s]  In the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and many organs.
[9787.06s -> 9793.06s]  We know that if you have a very good muscle health.
[9793.06s -> 9794.06s]  Right?
[9794.06s -> 9797.06s]  Your health overall, your metabolic health is going to be good.
[9797.06s -> 9800.06s]  Could you be releasing great exosomes?
[9800.06s -> 9803.06s]  They're very pro-oxidative.
[9803.06s -> 9806.06s]  Which counteract the glycolytic phenotype of cancer.
[9806.06s -> 9810.06s]  And could those exosomes travel directly to the cancer cells.
[9810.06s -> 9812.06s]  And counteract that.
[9812.06s -> 9815.06s]  And penetrate inside the cancer cells.
[9815.06s -> 9818.06s]  To transform the glycolytic phenotype.
[9818.06s -> 9821.06s]  Of the cancer cells into more oxidative phenotype.
[9821.06s -> 9823.06s]  And keep cancer at bay.
[9823.06s -> 9824.06s]  We don't know yet.
[9824.06s -> 9826.06s]  But we're suspecting that.
[9826.06s -> 9829.06s]  We're scratching the surface of something that potentially could be.
[9829.06s -> 9831.06s]  A very interesting thing.
[9831.06s -> 9833.06s]  To understand better the effects of exercise.
[9833.06s -> 9835.06s]  As well as neuro therapeutics.
[9835.06s -> 9837.06s]  Yeah, I just, I mean.
[9837.06s -> 9838.06s]  The more.
[9838.06s -> 9840.06s]  The deeper I go in the rabbit hole.
[9840.06s -> 9843.06s]  Into all things that relate to longevity.
[9843.06s -> 9844.06s]  The more convinced I am.
[9844.06s -> 9846.06s]  That if you're going to rank order things.
[9846.06s -> 9848.06s]  If you were forced to rank order things.
[9848.06s -> 9851.06s]  There's nothing that ranks above exercise.
[9851.06s -> 9854.06s]  As the single most potent tool.
[9854.06s -> 9857.06s]  Or agent we have to impact longevity.
[9857.06s -> 9859.06s]  And yet paradoxically.
[9859.06s -> 9861.06s]  In the acute setting.
[9861.06s -> 9864.06s]  Exercise seems to do everything incorrectly.
[9864.06s -> 9865.06s]  Right?
[9865.06s -> 9867.06s]  In the very short acute setting.
[9867.06s -> 9869.06s]  If you look at it in that narrow context.
[9869.06s -> 9871.06s]  Exercise does not appear to be.
[9871.06s -> 9872.06s]  Giro protective.
[9872.06s -> 9873.06s]  But of course.
[9873.06s -> 9876.06s]  When you look at the chronic impacts of exercise.
[9876.06s -> 9878.06s]  And what's taking place.
[9878.06s -> 9880.06s]  After the bouts of exercise.
[9880.06s -> 9883.06s]  The data seem undeniable.
[9883.06s -> 9885.06s]  I want to kind of pivot from exercise.
[9885.06s -> 9887.06s]  A bit into.
[9887.06s -> 9888.06s]  A subset of that.
[9888.06s -> 9890.06s]  Which is something you published this year.
[9890.06s -> 9892.06s]  In long COVID patients.
[9892.06s -> 9894.06s]  So.
[9894.06s -> 9895.06s]  You know.
[9895.06s -> 9896.06s]  We'll link to the study.
[9896.06s -> 9897.06s]  So people can see it.
[9897.06s -> 9899.06s]  But you demonstrated that.
[9899.06s -> 9901.06s]  In people with long COVID.
[9901.06s -> 9903.06s]  Even previously.
[9903.06s -> 9905.06s]  Healthy people.
[9905.06s -> 9906.06s]  They basically.
[9906.06s -> 9908.06s]  From a mitochondrial standpoint.
[9908.06s -> 9910.06s]  End up looking like.
[9910.06s -> 9912.06s]  People with type 2 diabetes.
[9912.06s -> 9913.06s]  When they're done.
[9913.06s -> 9914.06s]  In terms of fat oxidation.
[9914.06s -> 9915.06s]  Lactate production.
[9915.06s -> 9916.06s]  Yeah.
[9916.06s -> 9918.06s]  So first question for you is.
[9918.06s -> 9920.06s]  What fraction of.
[9920.06s -> 9922.06s]  Patients recovering from COVID.
[9922.06s -> 9923.06s]  Do you believe.
[9923.06s -> 9925.06s]  Are susceptible to that phenotype?
[9925.06s -> 9927.06s]  That's a great question.
[9927.06s -> 9929.06s]  And they're trying to understand that.
[9929.06s -> 9930.06s]  So.
[9930.06s -> 9931.06s]  Everything started by.
[9931.06s -> 9932.06s]  You know.
[9932.06s -> 9933.06s]  You know.
[9933.06s -> 9934.06s]  National Jewish hospital.
[9934.06s -> 9935.06s]  Is.
[9935.06s -> 9936.06s]  Probably.
[9936.06s -> 9937.06s]  You know.
[9937.06s -> 9938.06s]  With Mayo Clinic.
[9938.06s -> 9939.06s]  Competing for the top one.
[9939.06s -> 9940.06s]  Pulmonology hospital.
[9940.06s -> 9941.06s]  In the country.
[9941.06s -> 9942.06s]  So.
[9942.06s -> 9943.06s]  You have these.
[9943.06s -> 9944.06s]  People.
[9944.06s -> 9945.06s]  With long COVID.
[9945.06s -> 9946.06s]  Who are.
[9946.06s -> 9947.06s]  Struggling.
[9947.06s -> 9948.06s]  You know.
[9948.06s -> 9949.06s]  They go up the stairs.
[9949.06s -> 9950.06s]  And they can't breathe.
[9950.06s -> 9951.06s]  So the first thing they do.
[9951.06s -> 9952.06s]  Is they go.
[9952.06s -> 9953.06s]  To different doctors.
[9953.06s -> 9954.06s]  And they end up.
[9954.06s -> 9955.06s]  Going to this.
[9955.06s -> 9956.06s]  Top hospital.
[9956.06s -> 9957.06s]  So they do.
[9957.06s -> 9958.06s]  You know.
[9958.06s -> 9959.06s]  Pulmonary function tests.
[9959.06s -> 9960.06s]  And it's completely normal.
[9960.06s -> 9961.06s]  So.
[9961.06s -> 9962.06s]  It's completely normal.
[9962.06s -> 9963.06s]  Then they.
[9963.06s -> 9964.06s]  Okay.
[9964.06s -> 9965.06s]  The next suspicious.
[9965.06s -> 9966.06s]  Is because COVID.
[9966.06s -> 9967.06s]  Also.
[9967.06s -> 9968.06s]  Affects.
[9968.06s -> 9969.06s]  The cardiac.
[9969.06s -> 9970.06s]  Muscles.
[9970.06s -> 9971.06s]  Right.
[9971.06s -> 9972.06s]  So let's just do.
[9972.06s -> 9973.06s]  Let's look at the cardio function.
[9973.06s -> 9974.06s]  It's completely normal.
[9974.06s -> 9975.06s]  And.
[9975.06s -> 9976.06s]  They're very good.
[9976.06s -> 9977.06s]  At this hospital.
[9977.06s -> 9978.06s]  Where they do.
[9978.06s -> 9979.06s]  Metabolic testing.
[9979.06s -> 9980.06s]  They do.
[9980.06s -> 9981.06s]  CPET testing.
[9981.06s -> 9982.06s]  That's how you call it.
[9982.06s -> 9983.06s]  Medically.
[9983.06s -> 9984.06s]  Right.
[9984.06s -> 9985.06s]  The physiological testing.
[9985.06s -> 9986.06s]  And they even.
[9986.06s -> 9987.06s]  Lactate.
[9987.06s -> 9988.06s]  We've been.
[9988.06s -> 9989.06s]  I've been interacting with them.
[9989.06s -> 9990.06s]  A few times.
[9990.06s -> 9991.06s]  And.
[9991.06s -> 9992.06s]  You know.
[9992.06s -> 9993.06s]  We've seen.
[9993.06s -> 9994.06s]  These patients.
[9994.06s -> 9995.06s]  We have 50.
[9995.06s -> 9996.06s]  25 of them.
[9996.06s -> 9997.06s]  They had.
[9997.06s -> 9998.06s]  Previously.
[9998.06s -> 9999.06s]  You know.
[9999.06s -> 10000.06s]  Underlying conditions.
[10000.06s -> 10001.06s]  Right.
[10001.06s -> 10002.06s]  The other.
[10002.06s -> 10003.06s]  25.
[10003.06s -> 10004.06s]  They were normal.
[10004.06s -> 10005.06s]  People.
[10005.06s -> 10006.06s]  And in fact.
[10006.06s -> 10007.06s]  Most of them.
[10007.06s -> 10008.06s]  They were.
[10008.06s -> 10009.06s]  Morally active.
[10009.06s -> 10010.06s]  Some of them.
[10010.06s -> 10011.06s]  They were doing.
[10011.06s -> 10012.06s]  Marathons.
[10012.06s -> 10013.06s]  Triathlons.
[10013.06s -> 10014.06s]  You know.
[10014.06s -> 10015.06s]  And.
[10015.06s -> 10016.06s]  The average is 50.
[10016.06s -> 10017.06s]  So they're not.
[10017.06s -> 10018.06s]  You know.
[10018.06s -> 10019.06s]  Very old.
[10019.06s -> 10020.06s]  Either.
[10020.06s -> 10021.06s]  Normal.
[10021.06s -> 10022.06s]  So we suspected.
[10022.06s -> 10023.06s]  There's some.
[10023.06s -> 10024.06s]  Metabolic.
[10024.06s -> 10025.06s]  Issue here.
[10025.06s -> 10026.06s]  So they send me.
[10026.06s -> 10027.06s]  All the information.
[10027.06s -> 10028.06s]  The raw information.
[10028.06s -> 10029.06s]  And I applied.
[10029.06s -> 10030.06s]  The methodology.
[10030.06s -> 10031.06s]  That.
[10031.06s -> 10032.06s]  We've been discussing.
[10032.06s -> 10033.06s]  Right.
[10033.06s -> 10034.06s]  Looking at.
[10034.06s -> 10035.06s]  Fat oxidation.
[10035.06s -> 10036.06s]  And lactate.
[10036.06s -> 10037.06s]  Production.
[10037.06s -> 10038.06s]  As a surrogate.
[10038.06s -> 10039.06s]  For.
[10039.06s -> 10040.06s]  Metabolic.
[10040.06s -> 10041.06s]  Function.
[10041.06s -> 10042.06s]  Or.
[10042.06s -> 10043.06s]  Metabolic.
[10043.06s -> 10044.06s]  Flexibility.
[10044.06s -> 10045.06s]  And mitochondrial.
[10045.06s -> 10046.06s]  Function.
[10046.06s -> 10047.06s]  And I was shocked.
[10047.06s -> 10048.06s]  Because they were.
[10048.06s -> 10049.06s]  Significantly.
[10049.06s -> 10050.06s]  Worse.
[10050.06s -> 10051.06s]  Why.
[10051.06s -> 10052.06s]  These people.
[10052.06s -> 10053.06s]  Cannot.
[10053.06s -> 10054.06s]  Go up.
[10054.06s -> 10055.06s]  The stairs.
[10055.06s -> 10056.06s]  And.
[10056.06s -> 10057.06s]  Where.
[10057.06s -> 10058.06s]  Before.
[10058.06s -> 10059.06s]  They were.
[10059.06s -> 10060.06s]  Doing.
[10060.06s -> 10061.06s]  Marathons.
[10061.06s -> 10062.06s]  Now.
[10062.06s -> 10063.06s]  What.
[10063.06s -> 10064.06s]  Are.
[10064.06s -> 10065.06s]  The mechanisms.
[10065.06s -> 10066.06s]  We know.
[10066.06s -> 10067.06s]  That.
[10067.06s -> 10068.06s]  Viruses.
[10068.06s -> 10069.06s]  Multiple.
[10069.06s -> 10070.06s]  Viruses.
[10070.06s -> 10071.06s]  Are.
[10071.06s -> 10072.06s]  Are.
[10072.06s -> 10073.06s]  Known.
[10073.06s -> 10074.06s]  To.
[10074.06s -> 10075.06s]  Hijack.
[10075.06s -> 10076.06s]  Mitochondria.
[10076.06s -> 10077.06s]  For.
[10077.06s -> 10078.06s]  Their.
[10078.06s -> 10079.06s]  Own.
[10079.06s -> 10080.06s]  Benefit.
[10080.06s -> 10081.06s]  The.
[10081.06s -> 10082.06s]  Majority.
[10082.06s -> 10083.06s]  Of.
[10083.06s -> 10084.06s]  This.
[10084.06s -> 10085.06s]  Long.
[10085.06s -> 10086.06s]  Covid.
[10086.06s -> 10087.06s]  Because.
[10087.06s -> 10088.06s]  As.
[10088.06s -> 10089.06s]  You.
[10089.06s -> 10090.06s]  Know.
[10090.06s -> 10091.06s]  There.
[10091.06s -> 10092.06s]  Are.
[10092.06s -> 10093.06s]  People.
[10093.06s -> 10094.06s]  With.
[10094.06s -> 10095.06s]  Long.
[10095.06s -> 10096.06s]  Covid.
[10096.06s -> 10097.06s]  Syndrome.
[10097.06s -> 10098.06s]  That.
[10098.06s -> 10099.06s]  Within.
[10099.06s -> 10100.06s]  Weeks.
[10100.06s -> 10101.06s]  Months.
[10101.06s -> 10102.06s]  Improved.
[10102.06s -> 10103.06s]  They.
[10103.06s -> 10104.06s]  Go.
[10104.06s -> 10105.06s]  Back.
[10105.06s -> 10106.06s]  To.
[10106.06s -> 10107.06s]  Normal.
[10107.06s -> 10108.06s]  But.
[10108.06s -> 10109.06s]  There.
[10109.06s -> 10110.06s]  Is.
[10110.06s -> 10111.06s]  That.
[10111.06s -> 10112.06s]  The.
[10112.06s -> 10113.06s]  Situation.
[10113.06s -> 10114.06s]  Is.
[10114.06s -> 10115.06s]  Going.
[10115.06s -> 10116.06s]  To.
[10116.06s -> 10117.06s]  Expose.
[10117.06s -> 10118.06s]  These.
[10118.06s -> 10119.06s]  Patients.
[10119.06s -> 10120.06s]  To.
[10120.06s -> 10121.06s]  Multiple.
[10121.06s -> 10122.06s]  Diseases.
[10122.06s -> 10123.06s]  Right.
[10123.06s -> 10124.06s]  So.
[10124.06s -> 10125.06s]  This.
[10125.06s -> 10126.06s]  Is.
[10126.06s -> 10127.06s]  An.
[10127.06s -> 10128.06s]  Area.
[10128.06s -> 10129.06s]  Of.
[10129.06s -> 10130.06s]  Concern.
[10130.06s -> 10131.06s]  And.
[10131.06s -> 10132.06s]  This.
[10132.06s -> 10133.06s]  Isn't.
[10133.06s -> 10134.06s]  Talked.
[10134.06s -> 10135.06s]  About.
[10135.06s -> 10136.06s]  As.
[10136.06s -> 10137.06s]  Much.
[10137.06s -> 10138.06s]  As.
[10138.06s -> 10144.04s]  it's ever going to be with COVID, but the rate with COVID is not zero. It's, I believe it's 2.3
[10144.04s -> 10150.72s]  cases per, gosh, it's a, it's going to be a big difference. I think it's 2.3 cases per
[10150.72s -> 10156.76s]  hundred thousand of people with COVID are getting myocarditis. Most of those are transient. They
[10156.76s -> 10162.64s]  recover, not all of them are. So a subset or not, but this mechanism would be distinct from just
[10162.64s -> 10166.38s]  myocarditis. Myocarditis of course, speaks to the inflammation of the cardiac muscle that would
[10166.38s -> 10171.86s]  explain depressed ejection fraction. But what you're describing is a far more diffuse problem,
[10172.08s -> 10177.54s]  which is, is a global insult on the mitochondria in the skeletal muscle, correct?
[10178.34s -> 10183.54s]  Yes. That's what we suspect from this data, which again is indirect, right? From the indirect
[10183.54s -> 10189.42s]  colorimetry in the lactate that it points out towards mitochondrial dysfunction. So that's
[10189.42s -> 10196.18s]  what we need to do now, biopsies to, to understand this at a better detail. What, what the heck is
[10196.18s -> 10196.36s]  going on?
[10196.38s -> 10202.18s]  Right. Could be at the micro profusion level too. It might not be at the muscle per se,
[10202.24s -> 10208.58s]  might be at the micro profusion, right? In, in, in, in the blood, um, uh, in the capillaries.
[10208.80s -> 10215.46s]  Meaning something like microthromboses that are preventing profusion and raising lactate that way?
[10215.68s -> 10219.98s]  Could be, could be, you know, uh, uh, that, that's where we need to find out. But we know
[10219.98s -> 10225.44s]  from other viruses, right? That, uh, that, that they hijack mitochondria and they interfere,
[10225.44s -> 10226.36s]  especially with, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[10226.36s -> 10226.48s]  uh, uh, uh.
[10226.76s -> 10233.74s]  fission and fusion, uh, uh, processes, right? Uh, some causes that increase, uh, uh, fission,
[10234.02s -> 10239.74s]  uh, some other causes increase fusion, uh, some other causes increase elongation. So we know,
[10239.74s -> 10245.86s]  uh, there, there's a wealth of, uh, of, of studies out there from virology showing that,
[10246.28s -> 10251.46s]  uh, yeah, many viruses and bacteria, they also, they hijack mitochondria and they,
[10251.46s -> 10256.16s]  they disrupted significantly. Now, um, but
[10256.16s -> 10256.22s]  um,
[10256.22s -> 10266.44s]  most of the times, like myocarditis, it subsides, right? It's restored shortly after the symptoms
[10266.44s -> 10273.54s]  are gone. Now, why this virus is different, that's what we are trying to understand. Why people after
[10273.54s -> 10281.62s]  one year, they are... And by the way, most of these people, they had just normal mild course
[10281.62s -> 10287.42s]  of COVID. They were not hospitalized. They were not in the ICU. Any evidence or inkling that if
[10287.42s -> 10294.10s]  people go back to exercising too intensely following recovery, it could exacerbate this
[10294.10s -> 10301.12s]  problem? And do you also... Yeah. Do you have a sense of which strains this was? Your work would
[10301.12s -> 10306.54s]  have been predominantly alpha and not delta and obviously not Omicron, correct? Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
[10306.54s -> 10311.00s]  exactly. This was done with patients over... Yeah.
[10311.62s -> 10321.48s]  Yeah. Even a mixture between the original variant and delta, so not Omicron. Yeah.
[10321.80s -> 10326.48s]  So in this population, which again is presumably mostly alpha, maybe some delta,
[10326.48s -> 10333.14s]  what was the distribution of male and female? So it was about... Yeah, we have 35 females and 15
[10333.14s -> 10340.08s]  males. So it was more female predominant. 70, 30. Okay. Which again, maybe is too small a sample
[10340.08s -> 10341.60s]  to know. That could be more an indication. Yeah.
[10341.62s -> 10345.98s]  Of who's seeking out. And again, we don't really know the denominator, right? We don't know
[10345.98s -> 10351.68s]  what this represents. Is this one in a hundred thousand? Is it...
[10351.68s -> 10356.62s]  Exactly. Yeah. It could be one in a million if this was everybody that's reporting it at the
[10356.62s -> 10365.30s]  time. Yeah. Our guess is like it's a rare event, right? It can last that long, right? But
[10365.30s -> 10371.60s]  we're talking about millions of people infected, right? If it's one in a million,
[10371.62s -> 10375.64s]  right? We're talking about some population that is going to need help.
[10376.06s -> 10381.88s]  Yeah. I want to kind of go back to just a few other questions that we didn't get to. So
[10381.88s -> 10389.04s]  not necessarily in any thematic order. What's the relationship between... Or how predictable,
[10389.22s -> 10394.30s]  I should say, is the relationship between zone two as defined by maximum fat oxidation
[10394.30s -> 10401.60s]  and VO2 max? So if you run somebody through a CPET and you figure out that their VO2 max is
[10401.62s -> 10411.40s]  at four liters, how predictably can you say at X percent of that, you will be at maximum fat
[10411.40s -> 10415.58s]  oxidation? That's a very good question. And there's another study that we're preparing the
[10415.58s -> 10424.48s]  manuscript with 225 subjects where we look at fat oxidation, VO2, and the relationships. Going back
[10424.48s -> 10431.36s]  to the same thing, we tend... And historically, the research studies with exercise have been done,
[10431.62s -> 10439.62s]  based on VO2 max. That's been the parameter to prescribe exercise. How many times we read
[10439.62s -> 10445.78s]  X amount of subjects, they were exercising for six months at 60% of VO2 max or whatever, right?
[10446.40s -> 10449.64s]  Now, that's another thing that I've been thinking of years.
[10449.64s -> 10457.88s]  And by the way, when they say that, do they mean the 60% of the heart rate that produced VO2 max
[10457.88s -> 10461.60s]  or 60% of the power that would... Yes.
[10461.62s -> 10468.00s]  That is their max power at VO2 max. Yeah. I mean, there's so many different ways you can do this
[10468.00s -> 10469.20s]  that I've always found it... Absolutely.
[10469.20s -> 10474.04s]  You have to get into the methodology very closely. I agree. I agree 100%. And this is where I think
[10474.04s -> 10480.06s]  we need to dial in things in better, right? Because yeah, 60% of the power output... I mean,
[10480.14s -> 10486.02s]  the intensity might be translated into power output, 60% of VO2 max, and then you translate
[10486.02s -> 10491.60s]  into power output, or you translate into heart rate, for example. Or is it 60% of the VO2?
[10491.62s -> 10499.00s]  So, for example, if somebody's four liters VO2, and then they hit that at 300 watts,
[10499.58s -> 10506.74s]  would 60% be 2.4 liters, which of course is not a very helpful way outside of a laboratory to
[10506.74s -> 10515.00s]  prescribe exercise to somebody? Or would it be 180 watts, which is 60% of the 300 watts?
[10515.58s -> 10521.60s]  Yeah, exactly. I think that normally the studies, they look at, okay, where do you
[10521.62s -> 10529.16s]  hit 60% of VO2 max? And then, okay, how many watts is this, right? Or what's your heart rate?
[10529.36s -> 10534.92s]  What's the wattage that corresponds to 60% of your max VO2?
[10535.38s -> 10540.32s]  Exactly. And in your study, what we are seeing, and this is what... Because I've been curious
[10540.32s -> 10544.42s]  about this, because we look at the cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise,
[10544.42s -> 10550.32s]  and we look at the cellular adaptations to exercise. Do they really correspond, right?
[10550.46s -> 10551.42s]  We know very well...
[10551.62s -> 10562.28s]  With athletes, you can improve tremendously at the cellular level, but not at all at the
[10562.28s -> 10568.18s]  cardiorespiratory level, at least based on VO2 max, which is the representative of the
[10568.18s -> 10574.94s]  cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise, right? An example that I always give when I give talks
[10575.30s -> 10581.50s]  is like an athlete who used to be an average professional, and the VO2 max was,
[10581.62s -> 10588.02s]  72.3 or something like that. And then two years later, he is a very good professional.
[10588.58s -> 10594.20s]  The VO2 max is the same, but the lactate levels were incredibly better from like,
[10594.38s -> 10600.46s]  I forgot, five watts per kilogram. He was at five millimoles, and now he's at 1.7, right?
[10600.90s -> 10606.54s]  So this is where the magic happened to this specific athlete, right? It was at the cellular
[10606.54s -> 10611.60s]  level. Yeah, and we see this across the board, right? VO2 max at the elite level, right? Exactly.
[10611.62s -> 10614.58s]  So the cellular level does not come close to predicting performance.
[10614.96s -> 10621.50s]  Not at all. Not at all. And this is exactly... So this is why we're putting together this study
[10621.50s -> 10627.66s]  with all this population of different... From people with metabolic syndrome all the way from
[10627.66s -> 10634.38s]  to the France athletes. So longitudinally, we see that, yeah, sure, VO2 max corresponds
[10634.38s -> 10641.16s]  with fitness in the same manner that watts corresponds with fitness, right? So we can also
[10641.62s -> 10648.28s]  imply that, sure, instead of doing a VO2 max to look at longevity and fitness, we can also do a
[10648.28s -> 10653.58s]  power test or a speed test and a treadmill, because we're going to see the same thing.
[10653.66s -> 10659.20s]  Those ones who are very poorly active, I mean, they have a very poor fitness, they're going to
[10659.20s -> 10664.18s]  have a lower VO2 max, they're going to have a lower power output, they have a lower speed,
[10664.18s -> 10671.38s]  lower lactate cleanse capacity, right? So VO2 max has been forever a great surrogate, right, for fitness.
[10671.62s -> 10677.34s]  And cardiorespiratory fitness and longevity. But we wanted to see if, in fact, it's really that
[10677.34s -> 10684.84s]  specific. So in our study, we see that people in different categories, right, at the same VO2 max,
[10685.44s -> 10692.20s]  they might be in different metabolic states. So some people at the same VO2 max might be oxidizing
[10692.20s -> 10700.28s]  a lot more fat or a lot more carbohydrates. So that means that does not correspond to the same
[10701.62s -> 10707.78s]  status. I would have thought that most people, by the time they're at VO2 max,
[10709.22s -> 10713.38s]  are, I mean, they would be disproportionately carbohydrate. So really, you're just saying how
[10713.38s -> 10719.16s]  much fat oxidation still remains there is really what you're saying. And I'm assuming a very
[10719.16s -> 10726.84s]  untrained person has zero fat oxidation by the time they reach VO2 max, whereas a more highly
[10726.84s -> 10731.48s]  trained person would still have some amount. They might still be at 0.2%.
[10731.62s -> 10735.52s]  0.2 or 0.3 grams per minute? Yeah. And for example, we see that
[10735.52s -> 10743.40s]  like a sedentary individual at 75% of the VO2 max might be around three millimoles,
[10744.26s -> 10751.76s]  whereas a world-class athlete at the same percentage of VO2 max is about one and a half,
[10752.58s -> 10759.08s]  right? So metabolically, they're different. Yet the VO2 max is the same. So if we prescribe
[10759.08s -> 10761.22s]  exercise based on VO2 max, we might... Yeah.
[10761.22s -> 10761.38s]  Yeah.
[10761.62s -> 10763.30s]  We might not do things correctly. It's crude.
[10764.24s -> 10771.56s]  Exactly. And the same thing with carbohydrate oxidation. At a 75% of VO2 max, like a sedentary
[10771.56s -> 10779.46s]  individual oxidizes about two grams per minute, where an elite athlete oxidizes about three grams
[10779.46s -> 10789.06s]  per minute. So that's a significant difference. And we also see it at a 50% already. So this is
[10789.06s -> 10791.54s]  why longitudinally, they correspond quite...
[10791.62s -> 10800.34s]  Well, and same thing as fat oxidation. Fat oxidation at a 50% of VO2 max is about 0.
[10801.54s -> 10811.22s]  Yeah. It's at 75% of VO2 max, 0.23 in the sedentary, and it's 0.6 in an elite athlete.
[10811.78s -> 10820.42s]  So, and then we look at the different intensities, for example, that an athlete that can have
[10820.42s -> 10826.82s]  at one millimole of lactate within the same group, not just comparing group, but we can see
[10826.82s -> 10834.50s]  that someone within a very same group, whatever the category they are, the lactate and the VO2 max
[10835.22s -> 10844.66s]  don't correlate. The correlations are sometimes either 0.2 or 0.1 or 0.3. So while longitudinally...
[10844.66s -> 10845.94s]  That's the R squared you're saying?
[10846.58s -> 10846.98s]  Yes.
[10846.98s -> 10849.30s]  Yeah. So basically no correlation.
[10849.30s -> 10850.34s]  Yeah. So very poor correlation.
[10850.74s -> 10856.58s]  When we talk about individual groups, when we look at specific bone parameter, which is lactate
[10856.58s -> 10863.38s]  with the VO2 max, it doesn't really correspond. So anyways, this is what I think that
[10864.10s -> 10869.70s]  we have learned a lot over these last decades, where we can really pinpoint more at the cellular
[10869.70s -> 10877.14s]  level to improve metabolism more than at the cardiorespiratory function, which is very
[10877.14s -> 10879.86s]  important. Absolutely. They both are going to improve.
[10880.34s -> 10887.22s]  Right. But I think that if we want to prescribe exercise, it's going to be more specific if we look
[10887.22s -> 10894.90s]  at cellular surrogates, like lactate, like fat oxidation, for example, right? Then looking at
[10894.90s -> 10905.62s]  VO2 max or METS, I mean, don't get me into there. That's very prehistoric in my mom's opinion. I
[10905.62s -> 10909.86s]  don't want to offend anybody, right? But the whole MET concept, right? Use for exercise,
[10910.34s -> 10914.50s]  prescription, it's hard to swallow in today's times.
[10915.86s -> 10921.70s]  Inigo, when we think about some of the muscle biopsy data, again, this term of mitochondrial
[10921.70s -> 10928.74s]  function, it's such an important part of longevity because it is one of the hallmarks of aging is
[10928.74s -> 10935.06s]  declining mitochondrial function. I usually explain to patients that the type of physiologic
[10935.94s -> 10939.30s]  exercise that we're prescribing, this zone two exercise,
[10940.34s -> 10944.82s]  is the way to measure mitochondrial function. It's both the treatment and the test.
[10946.42s -> 10951.46s]  But I'm guessing on the cellular level, there's even more that we can talk about here. So the last
[10951.46s -> 10955.14s]  thing I really want to talk about today, because I know we've been going for a while, you've been
[10955.14s -> 10961.14s]  generous with your time. When you get into the omics, when you start to biopsy the muscles, when
[10961.14s -> 10967.30s]  you start to look at the mitochondria in a way that we can't do it in a regular clinical setting,
[10967.94s -> 10970.10s]  what else are you seeing that's...
[10970.34s -> 10975.54s]  That's differentiating the healthy from the unhealthy mitochondria, or the high functioning
[10975.54s -> 10979.38s]  from the low functioning mitochondria? Yeah. So there's this... Again, I keep
[10979.38s -> 10983.78s]  talking about papers that we're going to publish, but we've been working for three years quite hard,
[10983.78s -> 10988.98s]  and now we cannot continue doing this. We need to start writing the papers, right? And over that...
[10988.98s -> 10994.10s]  You need more postdocs. You need more graduate students and postdocs to help with the writing,
[10994.10s -> 10999.94s]  yeah. But we have completed a pretty cool study, and they're writing the manuscript now. Looking
[11000.34s -> 11006.02s]  sedentary and active. We know already there are a bunch of research showing at the cellular level,
[11006.02s -> 11010.98s]  the difference between people with type two diabetes or mitochondrial... I mean, metabolic
[11010.98s -> 11018.74s]  syndrome and active individuals, or even sedentary. We want to see also, or we want to show that
[11018.74s -> 11025.22s]  people who are sedentary, they already have problems. And we wanted to compare them with
[11025.22s -> 11030.10s]  moderately active people, who should be kind of how we should be as humans, right?
[11030.34s -> 11035.70s]  So we looked into the mitochondria, into mitochondria. So we looked at their significant
[11035.70s -> 11040.50s]  dysregulation at the mitochondrial level, everywhere you look in the mitochondria,
[11041.06s -> 11046.98s]  in sedentary individuals. You see a decreased capacity to oxidize, to burn
[11047.62s -> 11055.06s]  glucose in terms of pyruvate, fatty acids, amino acids. You see a significantly decrease
[11055.06s -> 11060.18s]  in electron transport chain as well, all the complexes. And you see
[11060.34s -> 11065.94s]  also a significantly decreased capacity in the transporters of different substrates.
[11065.94s -> 11072.66s]  So one thing that it really caught our attention, and we think that this is something that we really
[11072.66s -> 11078.82s]  want to emphasize, and hopefully others in the future, is that we have identified
[11078.82s -> 11083.30s]  that there is the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, which is, as I discussed earlier,
[11083.30s -> 11090.26s]  that's the transporter of pyruvate into the mitochondria, which is dysregulated already.
[11091.06s -> 11098.58s]  Down, significantly down regulated in sedentary individuals compared to active individuals.
[11099.22s -> 11105.62s]  Then we are matching it with the pyruvate flux, the oxidation itself. So both the transporter and
[11105.62s -> 11112.34s]  the flux are significantly dysregulated. What does this mean potentially? So-
[11112.34s -> 11116.90s]  That's shuttling all, that's going to shuttle pyruvate to the other way it's going to get in
[11116.90s -> 11120.02s]  the cell, which is through lactate. Exactly, exactly.
[11120.34s -> 11126.90s]  So, and also what are the implications of this? So again, these people are,
[11126.90s -> 11130.02s]  they don't have diabetes or prediabetes, right? They're-
[11131.30s -> 11133.86s]  This could be a healthy person who's not active.
[11133.86s -> 11140.90s]  Exactly. And this is what, unfortunately, this being the model in most research papers out there
[11140.90s -> 11147.78s]  comparing the unhealthy with a sedentary health individual, right? I've been pushing for years
[11148.34s -> 11150.10s]  that the model should not be the-
[11150.10s -> 11150.32s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[11150.32s -> 11158.96s]  The healthy sedentary individual, because that is the intervention. As humans, we're meant to walk
[11158.96s -> 11165.84s]  or to exercise. So we need to look at perfection to understanding perfection. The intervention
[11166.88s -> 11174.88s]  of human evolution has been becoming sedentary. And in fact, I had a hard time to get an IRB,
[11176.00s -> 11180.08s]  to start a study. I have a hard time with the committee to convince them that using
[11180.08s -> 11186.40s]  active people as the gold standard to understand imperfection, that's the way to go.
[11186.40s -> 11190.56s]  But anyways, what we see is that these people already, they don't have clinic,
[11191.60s -> 11194.80s]  but yet they have a significant- They don't have clinical signs.
[11194.80s -> 11199.28s]  Clinical symptoms. Sorry. They're not clinical symptoms. They're the healthy sedentary
[11199.28s -> 11207.76s]  individuals. So they don't have insulin resistance and they don't have done regulation of GLUT4
[11207.76s -> 11209.84s]  transporters. Even hyperinsulinemia?
[11210.24s -> 11215.60s]  Do they have even, are they hyperinsulinemic when challenged with the glucose tolerance test?
[11215.60s -> 11221.68s]  These people, they have no symptoms. They haven't reported any glucose tolerance test. That is
[11221.68s -> 11229.36s]  abnormal, normal people. And then they have a significant disruption in this mitochondrial
[11229.36s -> 11238.88s]  pyruvate carrier. So, which might mean that the first door that might be jammed is that entrance
[11238.88s -> 11239.82s]  of pyruvate intestine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[11239.82s -> 11243.18s]  collation of diamond chondria. Most of the research in diabetes has done more at the
[11243.18s -> 11248.70s]  peripheral level, if you will, glucose levels, more at the surface levels of the cell, the GLUT4,
[11248.70s -> 11254.06s]  the insulin resistance, the pancreas release of insulin, the beta cells, et cetera. But what's
[11254.06s -> 11261.26s]  the fate of glucose when it enters the cell. And this is what we looked into this. And the fate is
[11261.26s -> 11265.26s]  pyruvate. But what's the fate of pyruvate? As you said, very well. Does it enter the mitochondria or
[11265.26s -> 11265.34s]  but the fat of the pyruvate what's it is theitolate? But does it enter the mitochondria, or
[11265.34s -> 11265.50s]  does it settle some of the bacterial cells and inject the cells into the tspot until it happens?
[11265.50s -> 11266.14s]  Because a bacteria like 화2 becoming theェrm авatids, all of these plantwasters Okay.
[11266.14s -> 11275.28s]  or reduced to lactate. So I think that this is important to see because it could be a marker
[11275.28s -> 11280.88s]  down the road. Because again, these people don't have clinical symptoms, yet they have a significant
[11280.88s -> 11288.44s]  dysregulation in their glucose metabolism. So could this be 10, 15 years ahead of clinical
[11288.44s -> 11294.52s]  symptoms and insulin resistance? So this is more reason also to consider sedentary individuals
[11294.52s -> 11299.52s]  to see, hey, they have a metabolic dysregulation already. Same thing we're doing at the fat
[11299.52s -> 11305.40s]  oxidation level. The CPT-1 and CPT-2, the transporters of fat, they're significantly
[11305.40s -> 11310.82s]  downregulated as well. So that means they're not going to be able to transport fat very well,
[11311.18s -> 11317.52s]  which also matches to the fat oxidation itself, where we inject fatty acids into the mitochondria
[11317.52s -> 11323.20s]  that are not oxidized well. So they all match as well. So they have a dysregulation already
[11323.20s -> 11324.24s]  that is significant.
[11324.52s -> 11331.84s]  Compared to moderate individuals at the glucose metabolism and fat metabolism. Then we see that
[11331.84s -> 11337.38s]  many of these people who have diabetes or metabolic syndrome, they have what's called
[11337.38s -> 11343.12s]  intramuscular triglycerides, the fat droplet. And it's adjacent right by the mitochondria,
[11343.84s -> 11349.50s]  right? And it's a type of that in elite athletes, it's also there, that fat droplet,
[11349.50s -> 11354.30s]  but it's very active because about 25 to 30% of the fat oxidation comes from,
[11354.52s -> 11360.46s]  that fat droplet adjacent to mitochondria, which it could probably is an evolutionary mechanism to
[11360.46s -> 11365.78s]  not rely on the adipose tissue, which might take time and have something right away there, right?
[11366.10s -> 11370.32s]  So when you say it's metabolically active, the difference between the intramuscular fat of the
[11370.32s -> 11376.00s]  athlete and the intramuscular fat of the person with type two diabetes, is it the flux then in
[11376.00s -> 11380.68s]  the person with type two diabetes, it's a static source of fat in the athlete. It's constantly
[11380.68s -> 11383.48s]  turning over and being oxidized and replenished.
[11383.68s -> 11384.32s]  Exactly.
[11384.52s -> 11390.72s]  Whereas in this population, it continues to grow. My colleague Brian Bergman from the university is
[11390.72s -> 11397.04s]  working a lot into the content of what's inside these fat droplets. But one thing that we know is
[11397.60s -> 11403.52s]  they're very high in ceramides and diglycerides, and especially ceramides are key in the
[11403.52s -> 11413.12s]  atherosclerotic process. Atherosclerosis, obviously it's a hallmark of cardiovascular disease, and
[11413.12s -> 11419.08s]  ceramides are key for this process. Historically it's been thought and it's been shown that ceramides
[11419.08s -> 11423.72s]  come from the liver. They're released. But we're seeing that these intramuscular triglycerides that
[11423.72s -> 11430.92s]  high in ceramides. So could this be a connection between also cardiovascular disease and type two
[11430.92s -> 11431.50s]  diabetes,
[11431.74s -> 11437.28s]  But this is only in the high turnover high flux one? You're not accumulating them as much?
[11437.28s -> 11437.38s]  Yes, like people who are again, people who end up having diabetes because if you add those two things together, they are all different types of things. But this is only in the high turnover, high flux one, you're not accumulating them as much.
[11437.38s -> 11439.98s]  Yes, people who are...
[11439.98s -> 11440.48s]  Yes.
[11440.48s -> 11441.04s]  Yes, people who are...
[11441.04s -> 11441.44s]  Yes.
[11441.44s -> 11441.60s]  People who are...
[11441.60s -> 11442.28s]  Again, people who end up having, again, people who end up having type two diabetes, they're more likely to be in the liposuction.
[11442.28s -> 11450.00s]  end up having type 2 diabetes, they accumulate this fat droplet, right? Athletes as well. That's
[11450.00s -> 11453.62s]  the athlete's paradox, right? But athletes, as you said, they keep turning around and it's
[11453.62s -> 11461.72s]  very active. Whereas in people with type 2 diabetes or obesity, it's stagnant. It keeps
[11461.72s -> 11466.90s]  growing and it releases pro-inflammatory mediators. And it also is high in ceramides,
[11466.96s -> 11471.46s]  which are key in atherosclerosis. So this is where we're trying to establish the connections
[11471.46s -> 11476.56s]  between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at the mitochondrial level as a nexus.
[11476.84s -> 11481.42s]  Because we know that about 80% of people with type 2 diabetes, they also have cardiovascular
[11481.42s -> 11486.88s]  disease and vice versa, which is what we call cardiometabolic disease. So could the nexus
[11486.88s -> 11491.68s]  of all that a mitochondrial impairment? That's what we believe.
[11492.14s -> 11496.18s]  Well, what I take away from this is we're probably going to have to do a third podcast in a couple
[11496.18s -> 11501.44s]  of years because there's going to be a lot of data that's going to be published then,
[11501.46s -> 11504.88s]  that isn't published now. There's going to be a lot more questions that we're going to have
[11504.88s -> 11510.50s]  answered. Again, I'm still really yearning to understand the effect of metformin in terms of
[11510.50s -> 11517.68s]  pure mitochondrial function and performance in a trained individual. So as always, I just
[11517.68s -> 11524.06s]  can't thank you enough for your generosity of insight and look forward to talking tomorrow
[11524.06s -> 11529.04s]  when we have a call about some other nerdy stuff we're going to get into. But thank you so much,
[11529.04s -> 11531.40s]  Inigo. And also congratulations on the...
[11531.46s -> 11539.18s]  Remarkable success of your team and Pogacar, who's an amazing cyclist to watch. He's got everybody
[11539.18s -> 11541.30s]  very excited about the Tour de France again.
[11541.30s -> 11545.26s]  Well, thank you very much, Peter, and all the listeners. I really appreciate
[11545.26s -> 11553.04s]  what you do. I think that the first time I met you on the first podcast, we were two and a half
[11553.04s -> 11557.82s]  hours talking about mitochondria. And at first, I thought like, this guy's crazy. There's nobody
[11557.82s -> 11561.28s]  out there who's going to be interested in listening to two and a half hours about mitochondria.
[11561.46s -> 11569.82s]  And metabolic health. And you showed me that, yeah, the concepts are out there. And I was in a
[11569.82s -> 11576.36s]  moment where I was kind of, oof, not many people seem interested in this. And you were already
[11576.36s -> 11581.16s]  an inspiration for me to continue doing this. And the remarkable work that you're doing
[11581.16s -> 11588.86s]  to educate people and inspire people, it's something that, yeah, it's transformational.
[11588.86s -> 11591.18s]  So I really appreciate the invitation.
[11591.46s -> 11594.18s]  Well, thanks for being with us today.
[11594.18s -> 11595.46s]  Thank you very much.
