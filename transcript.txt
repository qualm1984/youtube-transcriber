[0.00s -> 5.00s]  So I've been asked to comment on the Llama 3.1 drop by Meta, and this video is actually
[5.00s -> 10.42s]  probably going to be a little bit shorter than a lot of people might hope for, but the
[10.42s -> 15.66s]  thing is, is there's a lot of nuance and subtlety to this conversation, and I've spent a little
[15.66s -> 19.80s]  bit of time talking to a few people and thinking through kind of what my position is.
[20.24s -> 24.76s]  And there was a podcast that I was on a while back where I kind of articulated my stance
[24.76s -> 30.18s]  on open source versus closed source, and right now, my position is whatever policy
[30.18s -> 34.72s]  maximizes research potential is the best option forward.
[35.20s -> 41.26s]  And so I ran this poll a couple days ago about, you know, Llama is about to drop, and I asked
[41.26s -> 43.90s]  everyone, like, should AI be open source or closed source?
[44.22s -> 49.44s]  Now, unsurprisingly, most of you out there are, like, pretty strongly in favor of open
[49.44s -> 49.72s]  source.
[51.16s -> 54.44s]  Vanishing minority is, you know, in favor.
[54.76s -> 56.04s]  In favor of strong closed source.
[56.94s -> 62.02s]  But also, like, it kind of varies from, like, depending on context, and what I mean by that
[62.02s -> 67.32s]  is Llama 3.1 doesn't seem like it's a threat to, you know, global security or, you know,
[67.38s -> 68.42s]  geopolitical stability.
[68.92s -> 73.06s]  It's not like releasing nuclear weapons into the ether.
[73.72s -> 78.72s]  Now, will, should Llama 4, 5, 6, 7, should those be fully open sourced?
[78.86s -> 81.52s]  That's probably going to be a very different conversation.
[82.18s -> 84.52s]  But Robert Miles actually left a really good comment.
[84.76s -> 86.22s]  A comment here.
[86.74s -> 89.14s]  Very thoughtful, as Robert Miles is.
[90.00s -> 95.56s]  But the biggest thing is, like, obviously, you know, open sourcing technology that can
[95.56s -> 99.64s]  create biological weapons, that's kind of, in my personal opinion, the biggest threat
[99.64s -> 99.98s]  model.
[100.48s -> 104.84s]  But then also, there's the worry about emergent capabilities is something that he mentioned.
[105.40s -> 108.22s]  So, again, 3.1, is it dangerous?
[108.52s -> 109.34s]  Probably not.
[109.98s -> 113.78s]  And I articulate it more in this post, just a little bit more.
[114.30s -> 114.72s]  But.
[114.76s -> 120.24s]  What I want to emphasize is that idea that whatever policy that we're aiming for, we
[120.24s -> 122.96s]  should be optimizing for research potential.
[123.54s -> 128.46s]  So, the long story short is, I think that Llama 3.1 being open sourced is actually a
[128.46s -> 133.90s]  net, major net positive for the world, because that gives more people the ability to play
[133.90s -> 139.72s]  with it, to tear it apart, to try and exploit it, to understand the safety mechanisms.
[140.04s -> 144.34s]  Because here's one thing that I like pointing out to people, is that there's plenty of safety
[144.34s -> 148.82s]  researchers out there, whether it's universities or independent nonprofits or even individuals
[148.82s -> 151.52s]  who can't afford to train these frontier models.
[152.16s -> 158.36s]  But by being able to peek behind the curtain, by not having it just, you know, a for-profit
[158.36s -> 163.40s]  corporation like OpenAI or Microsoft or Google saying, hey, we're the safety experts and
[163.40s -> 164.88s]  we're not going to give anyone else access.
[165.20s -> 166.52s]  And I know it's not entirely true.
[166.60s -> 169.30s]  They do give privileged access to universities and governments.
[170.00s -> 174.12s]  But at the same token, by giving unfiltered access.
[174.34s -> 180.86s]  These models at this level, before they are AGI, before they are super dangerous, I think
[180.86s -> 186.26s]  that this is a net positive because it enables more research to be done around safety, around
[186.26s -> 189.80s]  emergence, and around threat models of artificial intelligence.
[190.46s -> 196.32s]  So, long story short, open sourcing Llama 3.1, I think, is a great net positive for humanity.
[196.80s -> 200.58s]  Now, there's plenty of other arguments that we can have about the business ethics of it.
[200.86s -> 203.54s]  What is Mark Zuckerberg's long game?
[203.68s -> 204.14s]  Because...
[204.34s -> 210.06s]  He has demonstrated in the past that he is relatively unscrupulous and will create social
[210.06s -> 214.88s]  media platforms that are harmful to humans and that he will double down on profit motive
[214.88s -> 216.48s]  above all else.
[216.94s -> 218.74s]  So, you know, what is his long game?
[218.82s -> 219.70s]  I have no idea what it is.
[219.76s -> 220.96s]  I could only speculate on that.
[221.34s -> 224.62s]  But at least in this moment, I don't think 3.1 is that dangerous.
[224.82s -> 227.82s]  And I think that it is, that this is a good thing for humanity.
[228.00s -> 228.92s]  So, that's it.
[229.06s -> 230.32s]  That's my hot take.
[230.64s -> 233.00s]  Quick, I wanted to tell you about a new community I'm launching.
[233.14s -> 234.06s]  It's called the New Era Passive.
[234.34s -> 238.12s]  Now, this is on a different platform than what I've used before.
[238.62s -> 241.84s]  And this platform is all about learning, teaching, mentoring, and coaching.
[242.50s -> 246.04s]  So, just a real, real fast 20-second tour.
[246.18s -> 251.22s]  We have a community-based forum where I provide personalized feedback to community members.
[251.62s -> 258.12s]  We also have a classroom where I have built out and am continuing to build out coursework to master artificial intelligence,
[258.12s -> 263.50s]  as well as other lifestyle changes on a more philosophical level and deeply personal level,
[263.50s -> 265.50s]  based on the journey that I've gone through.
[265.94s -> 268.50s]  We also have regular Zoom meetings.
[268.88s -> 271.94s]  And so, if you want to, just go ahead and jump over.
[271.94s -> 273.16s]  The link is in the description.
[273.44s -> 277.00s]  It's called the New Era Pathfinders, and it's hosted on a new platform called School.
