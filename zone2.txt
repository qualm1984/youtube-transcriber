[0.00s -> 5.72s]  I tested once in the laboratory an 81-year-old gentleman.
[5.98s -> 10.42s]  I thought, boy, you've been doing sports all your life, right?
[10.50s -> 13.28s]  So, man, you chose the right lifestyle, right?
[13.52s -> 14.56s]  And he told me, actually, no.
[14.76s -> 19.12s]  Actually, until I was in the early 50s, I was obese.
[19.68s -> 20.60s]  I was hypertensive.
[20.96s -> 22.00s]  I used to smoke.
[22.90s -> 24.58s]  I had a very poor lifestyle.
[24.74s -> 25.94s]  I didn't exercise at all.
[25.94s -> 30.84s]  And one day, I started to ride and bike and think about life and things like that.
[31.30s -> 40.76s]  And ever since then, this was an individual, the early 50s, sedentary, very poor, healthy lifestyle.
[41.02s -> 50.58s]  And then, you know, 30 years later, at 81 years old, his metabolic health was that of someone in their 30s who's healthy.
[50.76s -> 53.00s]  That's unbelievable, hard to believe.
[53.00s -> 55.64s]  And this is how that person.
[55.64s -> 61.26s]  Obviously, 81-year-old, that's an example of what exercise can do for your longevity, right?
[61.76s -> 63.64s]  That person was not on any medication.
[64.36s -> 65.38s]  Hey, friends.
[65.68s -> 73.02s]  In today's conversation, I sit down with Inigo San Milan, PhD, from the University of Colorado, to talk about exercise.
[73.78s -> 79.30s]  Specifically, moderate-intensity cardiovascular training, otherwise known as Zone 2 training.
[79.30s -> 83.14s]  And how this type of exercise affects metabolic health.
[83.54s -> 85.30s]  This episode is extreme.
[85.64s -> 89.14s]  This episode is extremely detailed, which is exactly what I had hoped for.
[89.76s -> 95.80s]  Dr. San Milan is one of a few across the globe who is truly an expert in this field of science.
[96.14s -> 105.46s]  We're very lucky to have had this time with him, so I wanted to ensure we went deep on a topic that is absolutely critical to optimizing our healthspan and longevity.
[105.68s -> 114.36s]  If you do want to skip through some of the more nerdy scientific basis for Zone 2 training and jump straight to the practical stuff,
[114.76s -> 115.46s]  fast forward to about...
[115.64s -> 122.14s]  90 minutes into this conversation, where we begin talking about how an individual can set up Zone 2 training.
[122.94s -> 129.14s]  I will also be doing a follow-up episode with Drew Harrisburg, exercise physiologist and regular guest on The Proof,
[129.48s -> 135.06s]  to further summarize the practical takeaways from today's episode on Zone 2 training.
[135.80s -> 139.22s]  So, no stress if things don't land the first time.
[139.80s -> 142.18s]  It's a lot to take in over one conversation.
[142.88s -> 143.72s]  I hope you enjoy it.
[144.02s -> 145.60s]  This is me and Inigo San Milan.
[146.20s -> 146.88s]  PhD.
[147.62s -> 153.30s]  Something that I think we'll talk about at various points today is metabolic health.
[154.26s -> 160.50s]  What is your definition of metabolic health and why should the listener care about this?
[161.22s -> 162.56s]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[162.70s -> 167.48s]  And I think this is something that we're understanding more and more, right?
[167.48s -> 170.94s]  As you know and many people know, right?
[171.02s -> 175.48s]  The traditional definition of metabolic health is...
[175.64s -> 185.18s]  The compendium of the multiple parameters like your lipid profile, your blood pressure levels, your glucose levels, right?
[185.22s -> 190.84s]  And your body mass index or at least your waist ratio.
[191.16s -> 193.24s]  So, circumference, sorry.
[194.10s -> 200.52s]  But as we know more about the adaptations or what happens at the cellular level, right?
[200.52s -> 205.52s]  We are getting to an inflection point in the field of medicine.
[205.64s -> 214.54s]  Where metabolism has gone from being the poor brother to being the crown prince, right?
[214.68s -> 217.34s]  I mean, you look at the curriculum of medical schools.
[218.36s -> 226.50s]  Even still today, they barely have any courses, right?
[226.50s -> 228.98s]  Or notions of metabolism at the cellular level.
[229.22s -> 233.18s]  While at the research level, the advances have been immense.
[233.50s -> 235.18s]  That we can already...
[236.20s -> 243.60s]  Used to help people as well as to understand diseases at a level that we have never been, right?
[243.70s -> 255.28s]  So, this is why metabolic health implies more mitochondrial function implies also more fitness implies longevity, right?
[255.34s -> 261.04s]  So, people nowadays are not happy just to have good cholesterol levels, right?
[261.04s -> 263.30s]  Or good blood pressure, right?
[263.30s -> 265.62s]  Or good A1C.
[265.64s -> 267.86s]  Or glucose levels, right?
[267.92s -> 269.16s]  People want to be fitter.
[269.64s -> 271.98s]  Want to live longer.
[272.16s -> 274.84s]  Not necessarily in the months of years.
[275.28s -> 276.22s]  Because we all want more.
[276.34s -> 277.84s]  But to live better, right?
[278.32s -> 280.34s]  And want to be healthier.
[280.56s -> 285.68s]  So, all this, I would put it in the new basket, if you will, of metabolic health.
[285.68s -> 294.60s]  A lot of your work seems to focus on how efficiently we can take the, I guess, potential energy in food.
[294.60s -> 303.60s]  Be it carbohydrates or fat and turn that from a chemical energy into a mechanical energy.
[303.60s -> 307.60s]  Contract the muscle and move the skeleton.
[307.60s -> 311.60s]  Do you also consider sort of fuel partitioning?
[311.60s -> 315.60s]  You know, I'm interested in some of Professor Roy Taylor's work.
[315.60s -> 324.28s]  I'm not sure if you're familiar with him and his work looking at type 2 diabetes and this concept of personal fat threshold.
[324.28s -> 338.28s]  Being sort of integral to metabolic health in that once we kind of spill over or store fat beyond our subcutaneous fat capability,
[338.28s -> 346.28s]  it starts to get in between and within organs and that seems to also be a sort of key component of metabolic health.
[346.28s -> 347.28s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[347.28s -> 348.28s]  There's no doubt about it.
[348.28s -> 350.28s]  That's a big component.
[350.28s -> 353.28s]  Abdominal fat is highly associated.
[353.28s -> 356.28s]  It's associated with a cardiometabolic disease.
[356.28s -> 360.28s]  And also, there's more and more research.
[360.28s -> 367.28s]  One of the leading researchers is my colleague here at the University of Colorado, Dr. Brian Bergman,
[367.28s -> 375.28s]  with his research in intramuscular fat, which is highly, and others, right?
[375.28s -> 382.28s]  They have been doing research, extensive research on this, linking that intramuscular fat
[382.28s -> 386.28s]  with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes as well.
[386.28s -> 388.28s]  So yeah, definitely fat.
[388.28s -> 395.28s]  The connection between fat and metabolic diseases is there for sure.
[395.28s -> 401.28s]  And we are doing already in our laboratory and yeah, which we can talk in more detail later if you want.
[401.28s -> 402.28s]  Sure.
[402.28s -> 411.28s]  How much of your understanding of how exercise specifically influences metabolic health has come from your work with ELITE?
[411.28s -> 419.28s]  And why are ELITE athletes sort of a good model for studying metabolic health?
[419.28s -> 421.28s]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[421.28s -> 422.28s]  Thank you.
[422.28s -> 430.28s]  So I always say it's difficult or not very, you know, it's difficult to understand imperfection.
[430.28s -> 433.28s]  You wouldn't know perfection in the first place, right?
[433.28s -> 439.28s]  So, and ELITE athletes are the perfect machines.
[439.28s -> 440.28s]  They are perfection.
[440.28s -> 444.28s]  And they're the Ferraris or the Lamborghinis, right?
[444.28s -> 449.28s]  So from the lessons that we have learned from working with the perfect machines,
[449.28s -> 456.28s]  we can understand or have a reference of what perfection is so that we can understand imperfection.
[456.28s -> 464.28s]  So this is why I've been trying to bring for a couple of decades into the clinical space, right?
[464.28s -> 469.28s]  To push to try to understand, I mean, to try to bring the lessons that we have learned
[469.28s -> 473.28s]  working with ELITE athletes so that we can understand different diseases better,
[473.28s -> 481.28s]  as well as the application of different interventions like exercise, especially, and also even nutrition.
[481.28s -> 488.28s]  How much of the sort of cardio metabolic disease burden that we see today
[488.28s -> 499.28s]  do you feel is explained by sedentary lifestyles and a lack of specific cardiovascular issues?
[499.28s -> 504.28s]  So training versus other things like nutrition, which you just mentioned?
[504.28s -> 505.28s]  Yeah.
[505.28s -> 511.28s]  So I'm going to wear my cell physiology background, right?
[511.28s -> 518.28s]  And try to see this from a decrease in mitochondrial function or a decay in the mitochondrial function.
[518.28s -> 525.28s]  So mitochondria, you know, as we know, the powerhouses of the cells.
[525.28s -> 528.28s]  And this is how we have been learning about that for decades.
[528.28s -> 530.28s]  Right.
[530.28s -> 537.28s]  However, not until recently, relatively speaking, we've been very interested in mitochondrial function.
[537.28s -> 543.28s]  And now what we see is like pretty much no matter which medical field you get into
[543.28s -> 548.28s]  and you talk to leading researchers in multiple medical fields,
[548.28s -> 552.28s]  everybody's stumbling upon mitochondria, right, in mitochondrial function.
[552.28s -> 558.28s]  Now, when it comes to cardio metabolic disease, there are two main events that happen.
[558.28s -> 560.28s]  When it comes to nutrition.
[560.28s -> 567.28s]  One is the metabolization of carbohydrates and fats.
[567.28s -> 581.28s]  So during postprandial conditions after a meal, about 80% of all carbohydrates are burned or metabolized in skeletal muscle.
[581.28s -> 582.28s]  Right.
[582.28s -> 585.28s]  And it's time to really call skeletal muscle an organ.
[585.28s -> 588.28s]  It's probably the largest organ in the body.
[588.28s -> 596.28s]  And it's very important to see these because within skeletal muscle at rest,
[596.28s -> 602.28s]  carbohydrates, which are turned into glucose in the blood, no matter what type of carbohydrate you have,
[602.28s -> 608.28s]  whether it's good or bad carbohydrates, they're all going to become glucose in the blood like fructose.
[608.28s -> 615.28s]  Most of the fructose that you ingest is converted by the liver into glucose.
[615.28s -> 616.28s]  Right.
[616.28s -> 620.28s]  All that has to be metabolized and under resting conditions.
[620.28s -> 623.28s]  About 80% are done in skeletal muscle.
[623.28s -> 627.28s]  And within skeletal muscle, this happens in mitochondria.
[627.28s -> 634.28s]  So if you have a dysfunctional mitochondria or a mitochondrial that is impaired,
[634.28s -> 641.28s]  you're going to have a metabolic challenge because you're going to have to burn that glucose.
[641.28s -> 646.28s]  And if you don't do it correctly, eventually you're going to have a problem.
[646.28s -> 653.28s]  Because that glucose is going to be building up in the blood, causing hyperglycemia, high blood glucose levels.
[653.28s -> 658.28s]  And the pancreas reacts to that because it's dangerous to have high glucose levels.
[658.28s -> 661.28s]  And the pancreas reacts by releasing insulin.
[661.28s -> 669.28s]  And insulin triggers the transportation of glucose inside the cell.
[669.28s -> 675.28s]  But it's not just about the transfer of glucose inside the cell, which is what we've been hearing for decades.
[675.28s -> 682.28s]  The world of type 2 diabetes has been involved more at peripheral level, if you will,
[682.28s -> 690.28s]  at the level of hyperglycemia, insulinemia or hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance,
[690.28s -> 696.28s]  even GLUT4, which are the transporters of glucose that are stimulated by insulin.
[696.28s -> 703.28s]  But we need to start talking about pyruvate and about the fate of glucose inside the cell.
[703.28s -> 704.28s]  Because this is absolutely key.
[704.28s -> 705.28s]  Right.
[705.28s -> 709.28s]  Because one thing is to transport glucose inside the cell.
[709.28s -> 718.28s]  And the other thing is to metabolize glucose to ATP and energy in mitochondria inside the cell.
[718.28s -> 719.28s]  Right.
[719.28s -> 721.28s]  So this is the key aspect.
[721.28s -> 728.28s]  So there's two sort of critical things here we're talking about with regards to glucose and metabolic health.
[728.28s -> 734.28s]  One is the ability to get glucose from circulation into the muscle cell.
[734.28s -> 740.28s]  And you sort of alluded to the fact that that's been the story for a long time.
[740.28s -> 743.28s]  And earlier you spoke about intramuscular fat.
[743.28s -> 750.28s]  And so to my understanding, part of that story has been that as fat starts to accumulate in muscle tissue,
[750.28s -> 753.28s]  it can make it harder to get glucose into the cell.
[753.28s -> 754.28s]  Yeah.
[754.28s -> 762.28s]  But what you're adding and saying is that the story of metabolic health and glucose metabolism
[762.28s -> 768.28s]  and the difference between someone with poor metabolic health and an elite athlete goes beyond that.
[768.28s -> 777.28s]  And we need to begin thinking about once that glucose is within the cell, how it is being metabolized,
[777.28s -> 783.28s]  which I believe from your work and it's something that we're going to discuss,
[783.28s -> 787.28s]  comes down to the function and health of the mitochondria.
[787.28s -> 788.28s]  Exactly.
[788.28s -> 791.28s]  And then the problem is like if you don't metabolize that glucose,
[791.28s -> 796.28s]  if you don't metabolize that glucose inside the cell within the mitochondria,
[796.28s -> 799.28s]  then you have a metabolic challenge, right?
[799.28s -> 805.28s]  And eventually, yeah, you're going to increase or you're going to elicit a condition of hyperglycemia,
[805.28s -> 808.28s]  hyperinsulinemia, eventually insulin resistance.
[808.28s -> 815.28s]  But the same thing happens also or the same metabolic problem happens with fat
[815.28s -> 820.28s]  because fats can only be oxidized in mitochondria as well, right?
[820.28s -> 821.28s]  Right.
[821.28s -> 826.28s]  When fats cannot be oxidized in mitochondria, they build up, right?
[826.28s -> 831.28s]  You cannot utilize them as energy, so you store them in adipose tissue,
[831.28s -> 837.28s]  but you also store them just into mitochondria in the muscle, right?
[837.28s -> 844.28s]  And that eventually increases that reservoir or the deposits of fat inside muscle, right?
[844.28s -> 849.28s]  Which is, again, as I said at the beginning, right, is highly related to insulin resistance, right?
[849.28s -> 850.28s]  And that could be a connection between, you know,
[850.28s -> 854.28s]  a connection between cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
[854.28s -> 860.28s]  We know that about 80% of, not 80%, I don't want to say a percentage yet
[860.28s -> 865.28s]  because we still have to learn more, but a big number of people with type 2 diabetes,
[865.28s -> 868.28s]  they also have cardiovascular disease and vice versa.
[868.28s -> 873.28s]  And this is what's been now termed more like a cardiometabolic disease, right?
[873.28s -> 876.28s]  Because it's the combination of both diseases, right?
[876.28s -> 879.28s]  So this is what probably a big nexus for this is.
[879.28s -> 882.28s]  It happens in mitochondria.
[882.28s -> 885.28s]  Let's define the term metabolize.
[885.28s -> 894.28s]  I know that term gets used a lot and it's certainly sort of widely used within the literature
[894.28s -> 897.28s]  talking about mitochondrial health and energy metabolism,
[897.28s -> 903.28s]  but we may take it a little bit for granted and perhaps someone's wondering,
[903.28s -> 907.28s]  what does that actually mean to metabolize something?
[907.28s -> 908.28s]  Yeah.
[908.28s -> 912.28s]  So it is to convert into energy, right?
[912.28s -> 920.28s]  So the food that we have, right, we need to metabolize them to energy.
[920.28s -> 925.28s]  And that happens in mitochondria.
[925.28s -> 929.28s]  So if you cannot metabolize it correctly to energy,
[929.28s -> 934.28s]  you are going to pose a metabolic challenge to that cell
[934.28s -> 937.28s]  because it's not going to be able to convert it to energy efficiently.
[938.28s -> 942.28s]  So it either is going to be building up, right?
[942.28s -> 947.28s]  And as in the case of fat, it's not good that it builds up around muscle.
[947.28s -> 953.28s]  If it is in the case of glucose, it's an immediate challenge, metabolic challenge,
[953.28s -> 959.28s]  because you cannot have high glucose levels because it can be dangerous, right?
[959.28s -> 967.28s]  And another thing that happens too is that when glucose cannot be metabolized correctly inside mitochondria,
[968.28s -> 972.28s]  pyruvate turns into lactate.
[972.28s -> 978.28s]  And lactate is a key metabolite for, it's a signaling molecule.
[978.28s -> 981.28s]  It's one of the most important signaling molecules.
[981.28s -> 987.28s]  And this is the work, 52 years of work that my colleague and mentor,
[987.28s -> 990.28s]  George Brooks from Berkeley has been doing.
[990.28s -> 993.28s]  Pretty much everything we know about lactate is because of him.
[993.28s -> 996.28s]  And now the implications of lactate in health.
[996.28s -> 998.28s]  So we know that lactate is important.
[998.28s -> 1005.28s]  It's a great signaling molecule that is probably very important for cellular homeostasis.
[1005.28s -> 1011.28s]  But when it builds up and it's too much lactate inside the cell,
[1011.28s -> 1016.28s]  it becomes detrimental to the function of the cell.
[1016.28s -> 1022.28s]  And we have seen that in different research that we and others have done.
[1022.28s -> 1027.28s]  But that's the problem of not being able to metabolize nutrients efficiently.
[1027.28s -> 1032.28s]  And this is happening already as a big part of Alzheimer's.
[1032.28s -> 1040.28s]  Alzheimer's has been historically only been focusing on the amyloid plaque,
[1040.28s -> 1046.28s]  which is there, of course, and is highly related to the progression of the disease.
[1046.28s -> 1051.28s]  But the whole thing is that every single drug against the amyloid plaque has failed.
[1051.28s -> 1056.28s]  Now that has led to many researchers to try to look into different angles
[1056.28s -> 1058.28s]  to understand Alzheimer's.
[1058.28s -> 1065.28s]  And one of them has been insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's,
[1065.28s -> 1067.28s]  which is a hallmark.
[1067.28s -> 1071.28s]  Before it was daring to even mention that, right?
[1071.28s -> 1075.28s]  The connection between Alzheimer's and diabetes or colic type 3 diabetes.
[1075.28s -> 1080.28s]  But it's now highly widely recognized as a hallmark of diabetes,
[1080.28s -> 1084.28s]  insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction.
[1084.28s -> 1085.28s]  So there's a big problem.
[1085.28s -> 1091.28s]  There's a big problem for Alzheimer's patients to metabolize glucose as well.
[1091.28s -> 1095.28s]  I want to put a pin in lactate and come back to it
[1095.28s -> 1101.28s]  once we've kind of walked through the different energy systems that the body is using
[1101.28s -> 1105.28s]  and how this may change at sort of different exercise intensities.
[1105.28s -> 1108.28s]  I know there's a whole sort of lactate, lactic acid story,
[1108.28s -> 1111.28s]  and I've heard you before sort of clarify a few things.
[1111.28s -> 1114.28s]  So I think it's important that we do come back to that.
[1114.28s -> 1120.28s]  Another term I want to define here, Inigo, at the outset that is thrown out a lot
[1120.28s -> 1122.28s]  is metabolic flexibility.
[1122.28s -> 1127.28s]  What does metabolic flexibility actually mean?
[1127.28s -> 1132.28s]  Yeah, so the term metabolic flexibility, it's not a new term.
[1132.28s -> 1135.28s]  We are starting to use it more, right?
[1135.28s -> 1143.28s]  But it's a term that it was coined over 25 years ago by Kelly and Mandarino,
[1143.28s -> 1144.28s]  as well as Gretchen.
[1144.28s -> 1145.28s]  Good pastor.
[1145.28s -> 1150.28s]  And even before that, in the late 1700s,
[1150.28s -> 1154.28s]  it was thanks to the work of Lavoisier,
[1154.28s -> 1160.28s]  who started to look into aerobic metabolism.
[1160.28s -> 1166.28s]  And so he started everything related to cellular respiration.
[1166.28s -> 1173.28s]  But the term metabolic flexibility in a very simple way
[1173.28s -> 1178.28s]  is the ability of humans to burn fat and carbohydrates
[1178.28s -> 1180.28s]  and to switch back and forth.
[1180.28s -> 1183.28s]  So when there is a carbohydrate availability,
[1183.28s -> 1187.28s]  like elite athletes, for example, or fit individuals,
[1187.28s -> 1191.28s]  they can use them very rapidly for energy purposes,
[1191.28s -> 1194.28s]  and they metabolize very rapidly.
[1194.28s -> 1198.28s]  When there is not much carbohydrate availability,
[1198.28s -> 1201.28s]  then you switch very well and very efficiently
[1201.28s -> 1206.28s]  to utilize fatty acids for energy purposes.
[1206.28s -> 1210.28s]  Or when you're fed fatty acids, you can metabolize them very well, right?
[1210.28s -> 1212.28s]  And all that happens in mitochondria,
[1212.28s -> 1214.28s]  or most of that happens in mitochondria.
[1214.28s -> 1216.28s]  At rest, everything happens in mitochondria.
[1216.28s -> 1220.28s]  During exercise, it can happen in the cytosol.
[1220.28s -> 1223.28s]  So it's inside the cell benign in mitochondria, right?
[1223.28s -> 1227.28s]  Because you can use it through the aerobic glycolysis.
[1227.28s -> 1230.28s]  But during rest, under resting conditions,
[1230.28s -> 1232.28s]  yeah, everything happens in mitochondria.
[1232.28s -> 1237.28s]  So that's, again, it's at the epicenter of metabolic flexibility.
[1237.28s -> 1241.28s]  So people who are metabolically inflexible,
[1241.28s -> 1244.28s]  there are people who cannot metabolize fatty acids
[1244.28s -> 1246.28s]  or glucose properly, right?
[1246.28s -> 1250.28s]  And therefore, yeah, as we mentioned earlier,
[1250.28s -> 1253.28s]  it's going to pose a metabolic challenge
[1253.28s -> 1255.28s]  because you can increase blood glucose levels.
[1255.28s -> 1259.28s]  On one hand, it's also increased fat deposits in the muscles
[1259.28s -> 1262.28s]  as well as then in the adipose tissue.
[1262.28s -> 1268.28s]  Inigo, is it those things that are driving the increased risk
[1268.28s -> 1272.28s]  of conditions like fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes
[1272.28s -> 1275.28s]  and cardiovascular disease?
[1275.28s -> 1281.28s]  Or is it the building up of lactate and other changes that are occurring?
[1281.28s -> 1287.28s]  Or is it sort of a coalescence, so to speak, of all of these factors?
[1287.28s -> 1288.28s]  Yeah.
[1288.28s -> 1294.28s]  I think there's a lot of, you know, multifactorial, right,
[1294.28s -> 1296.28s]  in these processes of diseases.
[1296.28s -> 1302.28s]  But many of these elements are acting or working together.
[1302.28s -> 1305.28s]  I really think, and it's my opinion,
[1305.28s -> 1309.28s]  that everything starts by a mitochondrial decay
[1309.28s -> 1311.28s]  or a mitochondrial dysfunction.
[1311.28s -> 1314.28s]  And where, as we mentioned,
[1314.28s -> 1317.28s]  you cannot metabolize nutrients efficiently,
[1317.28s -> 1321.28s]  which can lead to disease because, yeah, again,
[1321.28s -> 1324.28s]  hyperglycemia and increased fatty acid storage.
[1324.28s -> 1329.28s]  But the core question for that is, like,
[1329.28s -> 1334.28s]  what causes that mitochondrial dysfunction, right?
[1334.28s -> 1337.28s]  So what happens in mitochondrial dysfunction,
[1337.28s -> 1342.28s]  the main element that we know besides infections
[1342.28s -> 1345.28s]  or besides mutations that can happen, right,
[1345.28s -> 1351.28s]  at the level of acquired decay of mitochondrial dysfunction
[1351.28s -> 1354.28s]  is lack of physical activity is the main mechanism.
[1354.28s -> 1359.28s]  In the same manner that we know that the only thing that we know
[1359.28s -> 1364.28s]  that exists to improve mitochondrial function is exercise,
[1364.28s -> 1367.28s]  the same thing happens when there's lack of physical activity.
[1367.28s -> 1370.28s]  Yeah, mitochondrial function is going to decay.
[1370.28s -> 1373.28s]  So when you have, as we have, an immense majority
[1373.28s -> 1374.28s]  or immense amount of population, right,
[1374.28s -> 1379.28s]  an immense amount of population who are not physically active,
[1379.28s -> 1382.28s]  you have a lot of mitochondrial dysfunction
[1382.28s -> 1385.28s]  or decay happening in this population
[1385.28s -> 1389.28s]  combined with an excessive amount of food that we have.
[1389.28s -> 1394.28s]  So that's an explosive mixture, right,
[1394.28s -> 1397.28s]  that eventually is going to lead to disease, right?
[1397.28s -> 1400.28s]  So if you have a poor mitochondrial function
[1400.28s -> 1403.28s]  and you add more glucose or carbohydrates,
[1403.28s -> 1408.28s]  you're just adding gasoline to the fire, likewise.
[1408.28s -> 1410.28s]  And this you're going to see rapidly
[1410.28s -> 1414.28s]  because it's an immediate metabolic challenge.
[1414.28s -> 1416.28s]  You need to deal with that right away, right,
[1416.28s -> 1419.28s]  because you're going to have high blood glucose levels.
[1419.28s -> 1423.28s]  But with the fat, it's not an immediate challenge.
[1423.28s -> 1426.28s]  It's stored, but it keeps being stored, stored,
[1426.28s -> 1429.28s]  and down the road it's going to lead to disease.
[1429.28s -> 1432.28s]  But I think everything happens by mitochondrial decay.
[1432.28s -> 1435.28s]  But I think everything happens by mitochondrial decay
[1435.28s -> 1438.28s]  due to a lack of physical activity.
[1438.28s -> 1442.28s]  So for the average person in Western developed countries,
[1442.28s -> 1446.28s]  the current lifestyle is kind of stoking this metabolic fire
[1446.28s -> 1448.28s]  in two directions.
[1448.28s -> 1453.28s]  One is that lack of stimulus to keep the mitochondria healthy
[1453.28s -> 1456.28s]  and, as you say, leading to mitochondrial decay.
[1456.28s -> 1460.28s]  And I know that your work has looked very specifically
[1460.28s -> 1462.28s]  at how can we exercise it,
[1462.28s -> 1467.04s]  with intent how can we provide the best stimulus which we're going to get to which is the practical
[1467.04s -> 1473.34s]  side of this conversation but then the fire is also being stoked through the consumption of a
[1473.34s -> 1478.96s]  diet that is leading to excessive calorie consumption and and frankly i guess energy
[1478.96s -> 1487.74s]  toxicity to an extent too many calories um beyond the person's requirements you've you've mentioned
[1487.74s -> 1494.88s]  you've mentioned the word aerobic a few times and we've been speaking about mitochondria and
[1494.88s -> 1501.88s]  when i hear the word aerobic i think about oxygen i think about energy being produced
[1501.88s -> 1506.66s]  in the presence of oxygen and this occurring in the mitochondria
[1506.66s -> 1513.84s]  can you explain how this works i think that most people appreciate the importance of oxygen
[1513.84s -> 1517.14s]  in sustaining life but but maybe
[1517.14s -> 1517.72s]  do not
[1517.74s -> 1525.82s]  fully appreciate how oxygen is involved in the production of energy yeah so i mean oxygen is
[1525.82s -> 1532.24s]  it's it's necessary right at the in the in doing the uh what what we call oxidative phosphorylation
[1532.24s -> 1539.32s]  right which is the production of atp oxygen needs to be present right um um but that's that's at the
[1539.32s -> 1547.14s]  very end spectrum of the of the of the chain right of events of metabolizing the nutrient right
[1547.74s -> 1555.98s]  um but so that's what you know like most of the energy um uh metabolize nutrients metabolize are
[1555.98s -> 1563.12s]  under aerobic conditions however we we've been having you know that this idea that when you
[1563.12s -> 1569.94s]  exercise um at high intensity it's anaerobic right uh how many times we hear that i was doing
[1569.94s -> 1576.42s]  anaerobic intervals or i was i was i was i was anaerobic really hard today training for 20 minutes
[1576.42s -> 1576.62s]  right but that's it so that's how we do it right now i think it's it's it's it's not Gesでした.
[1576.62s -> 1577.52s]  we and Gigi come back and talk to each other about nutrition during that we and Gigi come back
[1577.52s -> 1577.58s]  but that's it so let's get right to the prognosis of�1 to�� to the 겨속 and bikini unpleasantness the outline of the word anaerobic regulations so i'll put it here for one second
[1577.58s -> 1583.60s]  that's not an aerobic right and this is what i think it's time to to to kind of change a little
[1583.60s -> 1590.20s]  bit the perception of this more from bioenergetic standpoint than from oxygen standpoint because
[1590.20s -> 1597.90s]  um everything uh pretty much up until vo2 max until you reach your your maximum oxygen
[1597.90s -> 1605.34s]  consumption which is almost your maximum effort is aerobic right beyond that point uh yeah it's
[1605.34s -> 1615.76s]  it's it's um atp cannot be synthesized right uh with the help of uh of oxygen um and it needs to
[1615.76s -> 1623.02s]  be uh the atp that is stored in the muscles uh it needs to be um utilized for energy purposes
[1623.02s -> 1629.68s]  and that does not require an an aerobic metabolism so that's why it's called anaerobic
[1629.68s -> 1634.46s]  right exercise but everything up until then is aerobic what it changes
[1635.34s -> 1642.80s]  types of fuels that you use so within the big range of aerobic metabolism you can use
[1642.80s -> 1647.38s]  a lot of fatty acids and then not much carbohydrates or you can use a lot of
[1647.38s -> 1653.66s]  carbohydrates and not much or not many fatty acids right so that that's the key point you
[1653.66s -> 1659.94s]  know what is the fuel that you're using right within the whole um um aerobic realm because
[1659.94s -> 1664.22s]  that's going to determine um what is going to be the metabolic outcome
[1664.22s -> 1665.32s]  uh as well as the metabolic outcome of the body right so that's the key point
[1665.34s -> 1671.36s]  as well as uh for bioenergetic stimulus and cellular level what are you going to stimulate
[1671.36s -> 1676.98s]  what metabolic pathway what type of bioenergetics are you going to stimulate with one exercise
[1676.98s -> 1684.96s]  intensity or another right uh you still stimulate aerobic metabolism but you might elicit different
[1684.96s -> 1691.00s]  changes at the cellular level with different exercise intensities okay so let's let's step
[1695.34s -> 1700.76s]  back into some of the some of the changes that we're talking about as far as the energy
[1700.76s -> 1706.52s]  that comes in and that get's into the body and you start to feel that you're actually
[1706.52s -> 1713.38s]  having energy with you know you're as much as you're actually having energy with your
[1713.38s -> 1718.58s]  body and you get that energy with your body and it starts to feel like you're actually
[1718.58s -> 1723.10s]  building energy with your body and if you're finding that energy is a little bit higher
[1723.10s -> 1724.36s]  you might be thinking like i'm really getting energy with my body like that's not going
[1724.36s -> 1725.20s]  to play much part in the decision making process i think you know as i mentioned earlier i think
[1725.20s -> 1730.62s]  to how energy is being produced and where it's being produced we can kind of pair that with
[1730.62s -> 1740.26s]  the zone slash intensity yeah so um yeah i mean again the way i see zones is from uh
[1740.26s -> 1749.16s]  you know like a cellular metabolism glasses right um what so i see for example this is also based
[1749.16s -> 1756.46s]  on the muscle fiber recruitment pattern which is going to also um elicit different uh fuel
[1756.46s -> 1763.20s]  utilizations and fuel partitioning right so when we start exercising very easily like a very easy
[1763.20s -> 1769.94s]  walk for example or a very easy bike ride for those ones who are fit on the bike um the body
[1769.94s -> 1777.20s]  prefers to use fat for energy purposes now that doesn't mean that we don't use glucose right
[1777.20s -> 1779.14s]  because we we also use uh glucose
[1779.14s -> 1787.54s]  there is a misconception that at low intensities we do not use glucose we do use glucose and this
[1787.54s -> 1793.86s]  is i've been for almost two decades uh measuring in the laboratory fat and carbohydrate oxidation
[1793.86s -> 1799.80s]  rates at the wide range of exercise intensities all their exercise intensities and seeing
[1799.80s -> 1807.36s]  in grams per minute how much uh how many carbohydrates and and fatty acids uh you
[1807.36s -> 1808.92s]  burn or oxidize
[1808.92s -> 1809.12s]  you
[1809.14s -> 1817.00s]  I have been working on a uh by energetics and metabolic maps which helps me tremendously to
[1817.00s -> 1820.08s]  understand the bioenergetics and metabolic map which has helped me tremendously to understand
[1820.08s -> 1826.64s]  as i call of of what are the series of events of different intensities so again at different at
[1826.64s -> 1834.64s]  slow intensity we we we deploy a lot of the fat um um and then we use a little bit of glucose
[1834.64s -> 1838.92s]  right it's very low intensity and we we deploy we recruit the slow twitch muscle fibers that's what i
[1838.92s -> 1845.18s]  zone one, right? And again, when it comes to zones, the multiple zones, people have different
[1845.18s -> 1852.46s]  terminologies and interpretations. I'm just giving you mine, right? So then as exercise
[1852.46s -> 1860.72s]  intensity increases, then the muscle contraction gets faster, right? And stronger. So it needs a
[1860.72s -> 1867.56s]  higher metabolic demand to produce ATP. So that's what you start burning even more fat,
[1867.56s -> 1875.16s]  right? But you also start burning more glucose also, but not as much fluctuation in glucose
[1875.16s -> 1884.82s]  utilization as it is in fat, right? And this glucose at this stage is being used to produce
[1884.82s -> 1888.42s]  energy within the mitochondria. All of this is still occurring in the mitochondria.
[1889.06s -> 1895.96s]  Normally, yes, because it's the glycolytic flux, as we call, it allows the velocity of the glucose
[1895.96s -> 1896.90s]  to be used.
[1897.56s -> 1904.04s]  Through pyruvate in mitochondria, yes. Although some is reduced or transformed to lactate
[1904.04s -> 1910.32s]  in the cytosol of the cell. And therefore, there's a little bit of lactate production,
[1910.48s -> 1915.22s]  which also coincides with this intensity. A little bit, which is about baseline levels,
[1915.44s -> 1922.72s]  or a little bit about baseline levels, right? But this is where, at this intensity that I call zone
[1922.72s -> 1927.36s]  two, this is where you reach a point...
[1927.56s -> 1934.06s]  Where you oxidize the highest amount of fat, right? And this is a key point because
[1934.06s -> 1941.08s]  fat is oxidized exclusively in mitochondria, right? So when you reach a point where you
[1941.08s -> 1948.28s]  achieve the maximum fat oxidation is that, yeah, you're putting those mitochondria to work
[1948.28s -> 1956.64s]  at that bioenergetic system, which is the fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation
[1956.64s -> 1957.54s]  to the mitochondria. And so that's where you reach a point where you achieve the maximum fat oxidation.
[1957.54s -> 1966.18s]  So this is what I use this zone to prescribe exercise as this is what I see that this is where
[1966.18s -> 1972.82s]  you oxidize the most amount of fat. So we can see in many people, when we do this test in the
[1972.82s -> 1980.52s]  laboratory, we can see that we can translate this into heart rate, for example, or into pace,
[1980.52s -> 1986.82s]  or into power. So that is the exercise intensity that releases the highest
[1986.82s -> 1995.96s]  fat oxidation. Then we start, we continue increasing the exercise intensity and the
[1995.96s -> 2002.96s]  metabolic demand becomes even larger, right? So you need to produce ATP faster. And this is where
[2002.96s -> 2012.36s]  there's an inflection point where fat cannot continue producing ATP at the same rate as before.
[2012.36s -> 2016.36s]  So this is where glucose is called.
[2016.82s -> 2028.32s]  At a higher rate, because ATP from glucose is produced significantly faster than from fat,
[2028.76s -> 2035.12s]  right? So that's when glucose starts to being recruited. And then you see in the laboratory,
[2035.42s -> 2042.22s]  at this intensity, you see that fat starts to drop significantly. There's a significant drop
[2042.22s -> 2046.80s]  in fat oxidation, and there's a significant increase in fat oxidation. So you can see that
[2046.82s -> 2054.80s]  glucose oxidation or utilization. And at the same time, you see also an inflection point also for
[2054.80s -> 2060.28s]  lactate, because lactate and glucose go together. As I was saying earlier, it's about glucose flux.
[2060.74s -> 2067.38s]  The higher the glucose flux into the cell, the higher the lactate accumulation, right? So this
[2067.38s -> 2073.82s]  is what's starting to happen in this zone three that I call, which is a transition zone before we
[2073.82s -> 2075.86s]  enter a whole different...
[2076.82s -> 2086.38s]  bi-energetic terrain, which is glycolysis, right? Or, yeah, the glycolytic system. So this is when
[2086.38s -> 2096.76s]  exercise intensity is now so hard that fat can no longer provide ATP or be a substrate for ATP
[2096.76s -> 2104.58s]  production, right? And this is when you need to start deploying, I mean, carbohydrates and glucose.
[2104.80s -> 2106.78s]  And this is what we see that at this intensity, we're getting more and more fat. And we're getting
[2106.78s -> 2115.08s]  fat oxidation completely disappears. It's gone. At the same time, you see a big increase in
[2115.08s -> 2123.48s]  glucose oxidation and a sharp increase in lactate because of the glucose flux. And this is also what
[2123.48s -> 2132.68s]  lactate also has the endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine functions. So the endocrine function
[2132.68s -> 2139.18s]  of lactate is that when accumulates in the cell and cannot be metabolized in mitochondria, it goes
[2139.18s -> 2146.50s]  to the blood. And it goes to the blood, it inhibits lipolysis, which is the breakdown of fatty acids
[2146.50s -> 2151.76s]  from adipose tissue. So when it inhibits lipolysis, you're not going to be able in the first place
[2151.76s -> 2158.90s]  to bring the fatty acids to the muscles to be burned, right? And then secondly, and we have
[2158.90s -> 2162.66s]  published this recently, two years ago, that we saw and we demonstrated,
[2162.68s -> 2171.46s]  that lactate as an autocrine function, it also inhibits the fatty acid transporter. So in the
[2171.46s -> 2179.94s]  muscles, fatty acids, they have a door, which are the CPT1 and CPT2. In mitochondria, outside and
[2179.94s -> 2186.38s]  inside mitochondria, they transport fatty acids, right? So lactate inhibits both doors. So when
[2186.38s -> 2192.42s]  you have a high glycolytic flux and you use a lot of glucose, the fat disappears,
[2192.68s -> 2198.30s]  for several reasons. First, because of necessity to produce ATP, right, at a faster rate. And second,
[2198.84s -> 2206.86s]  because the actions of lactate on both adipose tissue and also on the transporters for fat.
[2207.10s -> 2214.20s]  So it's a way to, a feedforward mechanism, right? To kind of get fat out of the way and say, hey,
[2214.20s -> 2218.70s]  fat, you're done. Your job is done. Now we go into glucose. And this is what I call
[2218.70s -> 2222.66s]  zone four, right? Or people call it lactate.
[2222.68s -> 2226.52s]  Lactate threshold, although there are many interpretations of lactate threshold also,
[2227.22s -> 2234.20s]  or FTP, functional threshold power, et cetera, right? But all this is aerobic. All this is
[2234.20s -> 2239.58s]  100% aerobic metabolism, right? Although this is what I was mentioning earlier, the misconception
[2239.58s -> 2244.56s]  is like we're already in an anaerobic state, and that's why people call it anaerobic threshold,
[2244.56s -> 2252.36s]  right? We're still aerobic, right? Then we move on into the next phase, which is,
[2252.36s -> 2260.12s]  it's an intensity that is where you reach your VO2 max. This is an intensity where you max your
[2260.12s -> 2267.24s]  aerobic capacity, right? Your lactate, it's off the chart. Your glucose utilization and the glucose
[2267.24s -> 2274.08s]  flux in the cell is off the chart. There's no fat oxidation either, but you're at the intensity
[2274.08s -> 2282.34s]  where you have the highest aerobic capacity. And this is the VO2 max. And I call it that,
[2282.36s -> 2290.66s]  the zone five, right? And then lastly, I call the zone six, which is pure anaerobic. This is
[2290.66s -> 2296.12s]  where we're talking about sprinting or about efforts that last two or three minutes, right?
[2296.20s -> 2303.00s]  Where that oxygen that you were referring to earlier is not enough, or even glucose is not
[2303.00s -> 2310.28s]  enough to maintain, I mean, to synthesize ATP and then the muscles that need the ATP that's stored
[2310.28s -> 2312.04s]  in the muscles already without the need of...
[2312.36s -> 2320.16s]  Okay. I have a lot of questions. That was beautifully explained. Let me try and
[2320.16s -> 2326.48s]  summarize some of that and you can let me know if I've got anything wrong. But at lower
[2326.48s -> 2334.48s]  intensities, the body is using the oxidative phosphorylation system, this aerobic energy
[2334.48s -> 2340.02s]  production system, whereby energy is being produced within the mitochondria. And at very
[2340.02s -> 2342.34s]  low intensities, that's primarily, but not always, the body is using the oxidative phosphorylation
[2342.34s -> 2342.36s]  system. And at very low intensities, that's primarily, but not always, the body is using the
[2342.36s -> 2342.86s]  oxidative phosphorylation system. And at very low intensities, that's primarily, but not always,
[2342.86s -> 2342.92s]  the body is using the oxidative phosphorylation system. And at very low intensities, that's primarily,
[2342.92s -> 2350.62s]  being done by using fat as a substrate. There is some glucose and that's fat is predominating as
[2350.62s -> 2357.12s]  the substrate of choice at sort of zone one and two. And then as you start to go up above zone two,
[2357.34s -> 2364.30s]  you start to see an increase in the amount of aerobic glycolysis. So using glucose to produce
[2364.30s -> 2371.98s]  ATP within the mitochondria and the oxidation of fat starts to go down as you go up from zone
[2372.36s -> 2380.48s]  three to zone four, but all of this is still aerobic. And then once you go into zone five,
[2380.48s -> 2387.50s]  you start to get this anaerobic glycolysis. So we're now able to produce ATP from glucose
[2387.50s -> 2397.08s]  without the presence of oxygen. And then above that, is that where the phosphocreatine system
[2397.08s -> 2403.52s]  would kick in, the sort of third energy system? Yeah, ATP phosphocreatine. Yes, exactly. It's
[2403.52s -> 2409.04s]  what's stored in the muscle already, and it doesn't require oxygen for that. Yeah. And that's
[2409.04s -> 2415.36s]  a pure aerobic system that we have, right? Everything else is aerobic. There are some
[2415.36s -> 2425.10s]  sparks of anaerobic metabolism, right? But yeah, this is like the predominant is always aerobic.
[2425.78s -> 2427.06s]  So I have a few questions.
[2427.08s -> 2435.72s]  The first is, for a given amount of oxygen, is it accurate that we can produce more ATP from
[2435.72s -> 2443.16s]  glucose than from fat? Well, I mean, more rapidly. The important aspect, and this is why there's a
[2443.16s -> 2449.18s]  transition, right? It depends on the muscle fiber recruitment pattern. The way I would approach it
[2449.18s -> 2456.76s]  is like how fast you can produce ATP. That's going to dictate the fuel that you use, right?
[2456.76s -> 2457.02s]  So
[2457.08s -> 2468.64s]  ATP derived from fat is significantly much higher amount of ATP derived from fat than it is from
[2468.64s -> 2474.46s]  glucose. However, it's significantly slower. So that's why when you're in the lower intensities,
[2474.98s -> 2482.76s]  recruiting the slow twitch muscle fibers, you don't need to oxidize or use so much glucose
[2482.76s -> 2486.76s]  as at high intensities, where then fat can be produced. So that's why when you're in the lower
[2486.76s -> 2490.32s]  intensities, where then fat cannot be oxidized because it's not fast enough, and you need to
[2490.32s -> 2495.96s]  switch to a different fuel, which is the glucose, right? Which gives you significantly less amount
[2495.96s -> 2503.80s]  of ATP total, right, per mole oxidized, but it gives you a much higher amount of ATP, which is
[2503.80s -> 2508.10s]  why the muscles need that fast contraction. And that's why you have the fast twitch muscle fibers.
[2508.88s -> 2515.98s]  So why does the body prefer to use fat at lower intensities? Is that a survival,
[2515.98s -> 2522.20s]  adaptation just that there's more potential energy in the form of fat available in the body and
[2522.20s -> 2528.28s]  and it makes sense to conserve energy from carbohydrates for when you need to shift into a
[2528.28s -> 2536.40s]  sort of higher intensity to escape predation for example yeah absolutely and and and this is this
[2536.40s -> 2542.38s]  is this is the the one thing you know that the way we store food right so carbohydrates are like gold
[2542.38s -> 2552.06s]  right that the body can only store about uh 500 grams you know of carbohydrates whereas uh so
[2552.06s -> 2558.92s]  we're talking about that's uh uh 2 000 calories you know uh whereas that the the the the skinniest
[2558.92s -> 2566.00s]  individual um can can store more than 10 000 calories from fat right because fat is everywhere
[2566.00s -> 2572.04s]  right uh so uh i it's kind of in a way fat is in a it's kind of an unlimited
[2572.38s -> 2579.26s]  source of fuel right whereas uh carbohydrates or glycogen right that's how we store like
[2579.26s -> 2585.80s]  carbohydrates as you know so glycogen is a very very small uh storage compared to fat so that's
[2585.80s -> 2594.10s]  why it's gold and this is why um yeah which is uh as as our evolution you know we're um
[2594.10s -> 2601.52s]  aerobic creatures we're slow in general creatures right we walk a lot or we run at a low pace
[2601.52s -> 2602.22s]  right
[2602.38s -> 2608.16s]  um and that we can even beat horses in long endurance you know because we're more efficient
[2608.16s -> 2615.48s]  metaphorically speaking the horse has a lot of um um fast twitch muscle fibers we have a lot of
[2615.48s -> 2621.80s]  slow twitch muscle fibers and those mechanisms as they allow us like uh um i i cannot cite the
[2621.80s -> 2629.18s]  research now but uh uh but there's been a a few studies on on how and and and and and competitions
[2629.18s -> 2632.36s]  are very long competitions like uh like 100 and and and and and and and and and and and and and
[2632.38s -> 2639.58s]  100 miles or so where of a horse versus a human and a human can get to beat the horse right uh
[2639.58s -> 2644.88s]  obviously bigger for for both but many ways that you still want to get out of uh context but yeah
[2644.88s -> 2653.32s]  we we are born uh our evolution we're born to uh to uh to burn fat uh as glucose but to to be able
[2653.32s -> 2660.58s]  to store a lot of fat but our evolution has told us that a key energy not just for high intensity
[2660.58s -> 2662.36s]  exercise when when we're doing a lot of exercise but it's also a key energy for us to be able to
[2662.38s -> 2670.02s]  we we have to run away from a from a bear or from a lion right or or when we have to get engaged into
[2670.02s -> 2678.64s]  very high um stressful situations but also for the brain right we need your glucose and uh so that's
[2678.64s -> 2684.28s]  why it's it's uh the storage is very small and that's gold for the body so the body is going to
[2684.28s -> 2692.26s]  try to defend as much as possible the glucose or the glycogen storages uh by then uh
[2692.38s -> 2699.74s]  try to be more efficient at burning fat yeah there's a a really nice review paper i'm sure
[2699.74s -> 2706.38s]  you've come across this it was in nature metabolism by mark hargraves and i'll put figure two up on
[2706.38s -> 2712.90s]  the screen for those that are watching on youtube but it speaks to the potential energy that's
[2712.90s -> 2721.12s]  available in the form of fat in adipose tissue and glycogen in the liver and muscle and it sort
[2721.12s -> 2722.36s]  of makes it very clear that it's going to be more efficient at burning fat and it's going to be more
[2722.38s -> 2728.84s]  important that there's enough more of that across the times to use then i want to have I have been
[2728.84s -> 2732.62s]  certain that the muscle that i was specifically traveling in to in adipose tissue is going to be
[2732.62s -> 2736.98s]  more efficient at burning fat than that's a reasonable expectation there is obviously
[2736.98s -> 2741.70s]  a couple of different ways of when you say carbon until actually that seems to somewhat
[2741.70s -> 2746.36s] 'm not exactly concrete at all so it's put that out in the idea that there is this order of
[2746.36s -> 2751.10s]  magnitude more potential energy in the form of fat stored in adipose tissue as as you just kind of
[2751.10s -> 2752.14s]  walked us through
[2752.38s -> 2758.46s]  point of maximum fat oxidation we're providing a very specific direct stimulus to the mitochondria
[2758.46s -> 2766.32s]  which then causes it to upgrade or adapt or grow stronger which we can we can get into
[2766.32s -> 2775.44s]  in a little bit as to exactly what happens but my question is why that is the best intensity
[2775.44s -> 2781.06s]  to stimulate the mitochondria because you just made it clear as well that when we go into zone
[2781.06s -> 2789.02s]  three and zone four this is still aerobic so even though the the contribution of fat to the
[2789.02s -> 2796.60s]  production of atp may be declining glucose is ramping up and that glucose is being used to
[2796.60s -> 2804.82s]  produce atp within the mitochondria so why is it that we're we're chasing a stimulus to directly
[2804.82s -> 2810.70s]  target the production of atp from fat within the mitochondria
[2811.06s -> 2816.82s]  as opposed to just the total amount of atp that's produced within the mitochondria regardless of
[2816.82s -> 2822.28s]  whether it's coming from fat or glucose i'm not sure if i articulated that well yeah that's a
[2822.28s -> 2828.14s]  great question and uh yeah it's it's uh it's a complicated and we're we're still trying to really
[2828.14s -> 2835.26s]  um uh answer it i guess you know in a more articulated way right uh and and uh and in
[2835.26s -> 2840.94s]  more scientific way if you will right so what what i have seen from 30 years of uh
[2841.06s -> 2847.90s]  of work with uh with athletes with patients and research is that that's the intensity when i
[2847.90s -> 2854.38s]  started using it and and by no means i'm i'm saying i i invented hands-on too because that that you
[2854.38s -> 2860.04s]  know who knows who started i just say that my zone two the way i see it i started using it 30 years
[2860.04s -> 2868.54s]  ago and this is what i what i first i saw looking at lactate clearance capacity that that intensity
[2868.54s -> 2870.94s]  it was the one that improved the most
[2871.06s -> 2880.98s]  lactate clearance capacity uh and and performance so um um lactate is a it's a it's a mitochondrial
[2880.98s -> 2887.52s]  substrate because lactate can only be oxidized in mitochondria or or be converted back to pyruvate
[2887.52s -> 2894.12s]  to be oxidized in mitochondria so laxity is a great uh lactate is a great proxy or surrogate
[2894.12s -> 2900.98s]  for mitochondrial function then about uh 18 years ago i started to add uh
[2901.06s -> 2906.26s]  and carbohydrate oxidation rates in the laboratory and to measure as a to measure as i mentioned
[2906.26s -> 2912.98s]  earlier fat oxidation and i could see also that that intensity was the one that improved
[2912.98s -> 2919.70s]  fat oxidation the most right so that's what i developed this this indirect methodology
[2919.70s -> 2926.00s]  to look at or to assess mitochondrial function in a non-invasive way without doing muscle biopsy so
[2926.00s -> 2930.52s]  by looking at lactate and looking at fat oxidation
[2931.06s -> 2939.14s]  both are mitochondrial surrogates or mitochondrial substrates right so we can indirectly measure that
[2939.14s -> 2947.42s]  so and and my colleague george brooks and i we published in 2017 a study looking at the
[2947.42s -> 2954.40s]  correlations between fat oxidation and lactate blood lactate levels denoting lactic clearance
[2954.40s -> 2960.26s]  capacity and the correlations whether you were like an elite athlete an active a moderately
[2960.26s -> 2961.04s]  active individual or a non-active individual or a non-active individual or a non-active individual
[2961.06s -> 2967.52s]  or a person with a metabolic disease met a metabolic syndrome uh the correlation was was
[2967.52s -> 2974.32s]  incredibly high so that's what we know that they both can be very good surrogates for mitochondrial
[2974.32s -> 2980.68s]  function now that being said again this is why at first was a trial and error right i was saying
[2980.68s -> 2987.20s]  okay which intensity of the ones i define in my dictionary which intensities they improve
[2987.20s -> 2991.04s]  mitochondrial function the most i see so one so two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten
[2991.06s -> 2997.08s]  five right so with thousands of tests that i've done all right uh this is what i saw constantly
[2997.08s -> 3004.22s]  constantly that this was intensity that improved mitochondrial function the most and also i saw
[3004.22s -> 3008.58s]  that this was the intensity that improved performance the most so this is what i saw
[3008.58s -> 3016.24s]  this with with my athletes it was very successful to see this uh with with results and now this is
[3016.24s -> 3021.00s]  what i from the beginning i was saying from lessons learned from athletes uh can we use
[3021.06s -> 3027.46s]  this um um to to to prescribe exercise to populations with chronic diseases to stimulate
[3027.46s -> 3033.62s]  mitochondrial function so again this is a way um and and i'm sorry if i didn't do that the best way
[3033.62s -> 3039.96s]  but this is my way to explain why zone two is an important uh to stimulate mitochondrial function
[3039.96s -> 3044.76s]  not saying that the other ones are not going to do that right but what i've seen that this is the
[3044.76s -> 3050.90s]  most efficient and i've seen over 30 years for for almost 30 years this episode

[3077.24s -> 3081.00s]  you're you're looking at lactate not so
[3081.06s -> 3088.94s]  much as a problematic compound which it has been kind of labeled over the years but more so
[3088.94s -> 3094.60s]  as a window into the mitochondria to tell you how well the mitochondria in that person
[3094.60s -> 3101.62s]  is functioning so when you looked at people with metabolic syndrome what you saw compared to
[3101.62s -> 3108.60s]  sort of average people and elite athletes was that for a given sort of intensity
[3108.60s -> 3110.88s]  they were producing
[3111.06s -> 3118.30s]  much more lactate and so that was telling you that their mitochondria was not as healthy and
[3118.30s -> 3123.82s]  not functioning as well as the others who at that same intensity were producing much less lactate
[3123.82s -> 3129.12s]  yes exactly it's a it's a great surrogate to see what the mitochondria function and it's going to
[3129.12s -> 3135.98s]  become more and more uh part of the regular blood analysis that people do uh like when people look
[3135.98s -> 3140.46s]  at uh blood glucose levels like what what are your resting blood glucose levels right so
[3141.06s -> 3147.06s]  we're going to see what are your resting lactate levels uh because what we see in populations with
[3147.06s -> 3156.38s]  metabolic syndrome um uh or obesity uh or type 2 diabetes we see that at rest they have about two
[3156.38s -> 3162.92s]  to three times the level that healthy people have so if we have at rest if you look at athletes
[3162.92s -> 3170.00s]  the resting levels of lactate are 0.6 0.8 uh moderately active individuals healthy individuals
[3170.00s -> 3171.04s]  this is kind of our standard level of lactate levels and we see that at rest they have about
[3171.06s -> 3176.72s]  standard, how would we like to be? We're around 1 millimole. But we see that people with type 2
[3176.72s -> 3183.22s]  diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiometabolic disease, they have at rest,
[3183.34s -> 3191.04s]  many of them, 2 to 3 millimoles. So that's about 2 to 3 times the levels that
[3191.04s -> 3198.84s]  health individuals have. So imagine that your blood glucose levels are 2 times or 3 times
[3198.84s -> 3206.24s]  as high as what the normal should be in health individuals, right? So I think that this is
[3206.24s -> 3213.16s]  getting to be, it's going to be more and more a parameter for health, resting lactate levels.
[3213.16s -> 3220.78s]  And yeah, but that lactate, yeah, it's a great fuel. So that's the other thing too.
[3221.36s -> 3226.22s]  Lactate we've seen as a toxic product. It's probably the best fuel in the body
[3226.22s -> 3228.40s]  because it's...
[3228.84s -> 3238.12s]  It's metabolized faster than glucose, significantly faster than glucose. So if you give
[3238.12s -> 3246.36s]  most cells in the body the possibility of use glucose or lactate, they're going to prefer to
[3246.36s -> 3251.82s]  use lactate. The brain is a great lactate user. The heart is a great lactate user, the kidneys,
[3252.42s -> 3256.88s]  the muscles, obviously, but it happens in mitochondria. So you need to have a good
[3256.88s -> 3258.82s]  mitochondrial function. And the...
[3258.84s -> 3264.60s]  The problem is not, when it comes to exercise, it's not the lactate, but it is the hydrogen
[3264.60s -> 3271.60s]  ions associated to lactate, which elicit an acidic microenvironment in the muscle. This is the other
[3271.60s -> 3277.88s]  thing that we see in cancer, the famous now tumor microenvironment, which is the microenvironment
[3277.88s -> 3284.58s]  around cancer cells, which is very acidic. And that's a niche for cancer growth, for carcinogenesis,
[3284.74s -> 3288.82s]  for metastasis, right? That it's a big deal area, a big area of cancer. So it's a big deal. And so
[3288.84s -> 3294.42s]  research now and uh and and that tumor microenvironment and that the acidic microenvironment
[3294.42s -> 3300.12s]  is caused by lactate from from the tumor cells which is dysregulated in skeletal muscle is
[3300.12s -> 3307.34s]  dysregulated during exercise and um or accumulates in people who don't clear it correctly into energy
[3307.34s -> 3314.50s]  and and those hydrogen ions accumulate and they might it's it's part of the fatigue not everything
[3314.50s -> 3319.54s]  by no means there are multiple aspects of fatigue central fatigue peripheral fatigue
[3319.54s -> 3324.18s]  local fatigue that we still are trying to understand and explain but this is a part of
[3324.18s -> 3332.56s]  that where excess of hydrogen ions from lactate can impair both the speed and the force of muscle
[3332.56s -> 3341.86s]  contraction okay so lactate itself is not necessarily a problem if we can clear it and we
[3341.86s -> 3344.06s]  can shuttle it back in
[3344.50s -> 3351.90s]  use it as an energy substrate but if our mitochondria are dysfunctional it can build up
[3351.90s -> 3360.86s]  and along with that lactate coming for the ride are these hydrogen ions which change the ph within
[3360.86s -> 3371.42s]  the cell that then can affect perhaps contribute to fatigue and and power yes yes and and and when
[3371.42s -> 3374.42s]  it comes to disease uh it's lactate
[3374.50s -> 3380.06s]  um it's it's highly related to disease you know when it's not when it accumulates chronically
[3380.06s -> 3385.18s]  because during exercise lactate even in in a in a people in in a person who is not fit
[3385.18s -> 3393.08s]  lactate is going to accumulate fast but when the exercise ceases uh lactate levels don't
[3393.08s -> 3398.78s]  accumulate return back to baseline but in diseases like cancer or when there's a significant
[3398.78s -> 3404.06s]  mitochondrial dysfunction in people with type 2 diabetes that lactate accumulates chronically
[3404.50s -> 3412.30s]  right and especially in cancer the more aggressive the cancer is the more lactate is produced and uh
[3412.30s -> 3418.86s]  through our research we're showing that lactate acts acts as an onco metabolite that is it's uh
[3418.86s -> 3427.98s]  it regulates the expression of uh uh sorry it regulates the genetic expression of uh of uh of
[3427.98s -> 3433.78s]  the uh the expression of the main or the most important genes involved in uh in cancer we're
[3433.78s -> 3434.48s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3434.50s -> 3435.00s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3435.00s -> 3435.50s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3435.50s -> 3436.00s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3436.00s -> 3436.50s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3436.50s -> 3437.50s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3437.50s -> 3438.50s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3438.50s -> 3439.50s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3439.50s -> 3440.50s]  doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're doing this we're
[3440.50s -> 3444.82s]  And then we have two more papers coming out with two types of lung cancers.
[3445.72s -> 3455.34s]  And then we also see that lactate also regulates the transcription of main proteins that are
[3455.34s -> 3456.72s]  dysregulated in cancer.
[3456.72s -> 3462.72s]  And now we're starting to intervene in the study that we have now under review.
[3462.72s -> 3470.40s]  We are, with genetic engineering, we're knocking out, knocking down, sorry, the enzyme that
[3470.40s -> 3472.74s]  produces lactate, which is LDHA.
[3473.62s -> 3481.02s]  And then in breast cancer cells, we see that when we knock out that enzyme, no lactate
[3481.02s -> 3489.40s]  is produced and there's no protein expression of those dysregulated proteins coming from
[3489.40s -> 3491.40s]  dysregulated genes in cancer, right?
[3491.40s -> 3492.60s]  So it's a key regulation.
[3492.72s -> 3500.50s]  It's a key regulator of cancer that already Otto Warburg, a century ago, proposed.
[3500.92s -> 3506.56s]  Because now we talk a lot, we hear a lot about sugar, the connection of sugar and cancer,
[3506.80s -> 3507.06s]  right?
[3507.60s -> 3513.18s]  And that comes from the renaissance of the Warburg effect.
[3513.32s -> 3520.54s]  So Otto Warburg discovered in 1923 that cancer cells, they utilized a lot of glucose.
[3520.54s -> 3522.60s]  And that was the first.
[3522.72s -> 3528.32s]  That metabolic transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell characterized by that.
[3529.14s -> 3535.10s]  But what really struck Warburg was the excessive amount of lactate produced by cancer cells.
[3535.82s -> 3537.42s]  Now, that was back in the days.
[3537.52s -> 3543.10s]  Unfortunately, he didn't have the technology that we have nowadays to understand that better.
[3543.30s -> 3546.38s]  And there were not, the genes were not discovered, right?
[3546.38s -> 3552.60s]  And so, but yeah, he already, he was so smart and so ahead of us.
[3552.72s -> 3557.90s]  That a century ago, he already posited that cancer could be a metabolic disease,
[3557.90s -> 3561.44s]  which is not quite entirely correct.
[3561.44s -> 3566.74s]  But there's no doubt that the metabolic factor in cancer is crucial.
[3567.18s -> 3574.54s]  But the way how he described an injury of cellular respiration or mitochondrial function was lactate.
[3575.02s -> 3577.20s]  Because he already said, okay, wait a minute.
[3577.20s -> 3582.16s]  If lactate cannot be oxidized or burned in mitochondria of cancer cells,
[3582.72s -> 3586.14s]  it's because mitochondria are not working properly.
[3586.56s -> 3589.72s]  So maybe there's an injury of cellular respiration.
[3589.90s -> 3594.28s]  So this is the main thing that he proposed a hundred years ago.
[3594.28s -> 3596.20s]  Yeah, that's fascinating.
[3596.96s -> 3599.62s]  And some cutting edge sort of insights, I guess,
[3599.68s -> 3606.50s]  into where the world of cancer research and treatment might be headed from a metabolic health point of view.
[3607.04s -> 3612.64s]  My head is sort of thinking at the moment about two,
[3612.72s -> 3615.56s]  two different ways of keeping lactate down.
[3615.56s -> 3619.06s]  And I'm sort of wondering if you've been able to elucidate this from your research,
[3619.06s -> 3625.10s]  looking at elite athletes or looking at zone two training interventions.
[3627.78s -> 3641.48s]  Is it that elite athletes have a greater capacity to clear lactate or are they just producing less lactate because they're better at oxidizing fats?
[3641.56s -> 3641.96s]  Mm-hmm.
[3641.96s -> 3643.82s]  That's a great question also.
[3644.24s -> 3648.58s]  So, and it's been demonstrated by different researchers and among them,
[3648.64s -> 3654.30s]  George Brooks, that the feeder an athlete is or a person is,
[3654.86s -> 3657.06s]  in fact, they produce more lactate,
[3657.26s -> 3664.22s]  mainly because in the same manner that their mitochondrial function is more robust and more efficient,
[3664.78s -> 3670.28s]  their glycolytic system, which I also call in colloquial terms, the turbo, right?
[3670.28s -> 3671.94s]  The turbo also works.
[3671.96s -> 3673.10s]  It works better, right?
[3673.10s -> 3680.66s]  And in fact, we looked at lactate as a sign of high glycolytic function, which is key for performance, right?
[3680.72s -> 3689.54s]  So those athletes with very high lactate levels at very high intensity levels, they're really good at the turbo, right?
[3689.60s -> 3694.98s]  So they produce a lot of lactate because they use a lot of glucose for energy system.
[3696.38s -> 3700.74s]  Like some athletes can oxidize six, seven grams per minute.
[3701.30s -> 3701.66s]  Right.
[3701.66s -> 3701.74s]  Right.
[3701.74s -> 3701.78s]  Right.
[3701.78s -> 3701.80s]  Right.
[3701.80s -> 3701.82s]  Right.
[3701.82s -> 3701.84s]  Right.
[3701.84s -> 3701.90s]  Right.
[3701.90s -> 3701.92s]  Right.
[3701.96s -> 3702.32s]  Right.
[3702.32s -> 3702.46s]  Right.
[3702.48s -> 3702.50s]  Right.
[3702.50s -> 3702.52s]  Right.
[3702.52s -> 3702.54s]  Right.
[3702.54s -> 3702.56s]  Right.
[3702.56s -> 3702.62s]  Right.
[3702.72s -> 3706.00s]  Right.
[3706.00s -> 3706.54s]  Right.
[3706.54s -> 3706.96s]  Right.
[3707.14s -> 3712.72s]  But the side effect of that is they're going to be producing a lot of lactate, right?
[3713.00s -> 3722.82s]  But the virtue they have because they have a very robust mitochondrial function is that they clear that lactate from the fast twitch muscle fibers,
[3722.94s -> 3725.12s]  which is where lactate is produced.
[3725.30s -> 3731.54s]  They clear it in the adjacent slow twitch muscle fibers and in mitochondria of slow twitch muscle fibers.
[3731.54s -> 3734.40s]  And for that, you need transporters also.
[3734.92s -> 3740.56s]  So you need two doors, two transporters, MCT-4s and MCT-1s.
[3740.56s -> 3746.88s]  So MCT-4s are the doors that take lactate out of the fast-twitch muscle fibers.
[3747.48s -> 3760.14s]  And you need to stimulate that intensity training, not just to improve the turbo, the glycolytic capacity, but to improve the capacity of that door to shuttle lactate out, right?
[3760.14s -> 3780.44s]  And then the slow-twitch muscle fibers, when you stimulate those, you, as we mentioned, not only improve or stimulate mitochondrial function, because that's where they're the most present, because fast-twitch muscle fibers cannot burn fat much, so the mitochondrial content is much less.
[3780.78s -> 3786.64s]  But also, the MCT-1s are present in those slow-twitch muscle fibers, so you stimulate those as well.
[3787.06s -> 3790.12s]  So that's how kind of, in a nutshell, like that.
[3790.16s -> 3795.78s]  The lactate shuttle that was discovered by George Brooks in the 80s already works.
[3796.12s -> 3801.56s]  Let me throw that back to you and see if I've heard all of that correctly.
[3801.82s -> 3817.86s]  So lactate clearance can be improved or is a product of our ability to get lactate out of these fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are going to be activated and utilized at higher intensities.
[3817.86s -> 3819.86s]  I'm thinking sprinting or resistance.
[3820.14s -> 3821.60s]  Training, for example.
[3822.86s -> 3835.72s]  And so that stimulus is going to help increase the number of the MCT-4 transporter you mentioned that helps get lactate out of those muscle fibers or muscle cells, we could call them.
[3836.54s -> 3849.96s]  And then the lower-intensity work, so zone 2, which is mostly stimulating the slow-twitch, slow-to-fatigue muscle fibers, muscle cells.
[3850.14s -> 3857.50s]  Is acting in a way to increase the MCT-1 transporter in those cells.
[3857.50s -> 3879.52s]  So you get this sort of nice push-pull, I guess, lactate clearance system where if you're doing the right training sort of modalities or intense training at the right intensities, have the right stimulus in place, you can get the lactate out of the fast-twitch muscle fibers, get it back into the slow-twitch muscle fibers.
[3880.14s -> 3884.52s]  Which keeps lactate levels down and also acts as an energy substrate.
[3885.58s -> 3885.98s]  Exactly.
[3886.42s -> 3886.82s]  Absolutely.
[3886.82s -> 3893.20s]  And this is why I, yeah, the way I see training or exercise prescription is that, right?
[3893.22s -> 3895.20s]  It's like from a bioenergetic standpoint.
[3895.44s -> 3899.70s]  And as I always say, which energy system you want to stimulate today, right?
[3900.18s -> 3906.20s]  So that's where it's partitioning of cellular bioenergetics through exercise.
[3906.66s -> 3909.66s]  And we're talking about two completely different systems.
[3909.66s -> 3909.82s]  Like lactate.
[3910.14s -> 3913.44s]  And the oxidative phosphorylation system.
[3913.76s -> 3916.92s]  The lactate-shattling system out of the cells.
[3917.12s -> 3920.60s]  And the lactate-receiving cells, right?
[3920.76s -> 3922.42s]  The type 1 muscle fibers.
[3922.84s -> 3929.72s]  And everything is different intensities of exercise are going to elicit different adaptations and different responses.
[3930.08s -> 3931.36s]  So therefore, different adaptations.
[3931.98s -> 3937.44s]  But we are talking that all this happens within an aerobic world, right?
[3937.44s -> 3940.06s]  So still everything that we're talking about here is aerobic.
[3940.14s -> 3944.44s]  So you can produce plenty of lactate under aerobic conditions.
[3945.08s -> 3959.66s]  So again, it's just that that's how it's important when you prescribe exercise, whether it's for an athlete or for a fitness enthusiast or for longevity purposes or for patients to really identify training zones.
[3959.66s -> 3968.90s]  Because whatever you exercise, the intensity that you exercise is going to stimulate one pathway significantly more than the other, right?
[3968.90s -> 3969.90s]  So, yeah, you want to really target.
[3970.14s -> 3971.52s]  You want to know what you want to do.
[3971.88s -> 3974.42s]  You want to improve your glycolytic capacity, your turbo.
[3974.98s -> 3978.70s]  Because you're very good at, let's say, you're very diesel.
[3978.84s -> 3984.56s]  You're very good at very efficient metabolizing fats and lactate in mitochondria.
[3984.66s -> 3988.32s]  But you're not good at high intensity, you know?
[3988.56s -> 3991.90s]  So you need to stimulate that by identifying your weakness.
[3992.42s -> 3996.52s]  But for health purposes, that's more maybe for performance.
[3997.00s -> 3999.98s]  But although we lose glycolytic capacity.
[4000.14s -> 4020.60s]  So as we age and we want to kind of maintain some of that or a big part of that, but for health purposes, the main problem that happens as we age for longevity purposes is a mitochondrial decay as we don't exercise as much as when we were kids, it's a mitochondrial decay.
[4020.96s -> 4029.88s]  And again, what I've seen in my experience for almost 30 years is that that zone two is the one that improves mitochondrial function the most.
[4029.88s -> 4039.06s]  And that's because it's targeting mostly the slow twitch muscle fibers where most mitochondria are found.
[4039.64s -> 4041.06s]  Yeah, that's how I see it.
[4041.06s -> 4048.82s]  And again, like the way I see is through fat oxidation in laboratory as lactate cleanse capacity.
[4049.40s -> 4058.00s]  That's the area for me, or at least from my experience is without a doubt and many others, you know, they've been telling me this.
[4058.56s -> 4059.86s]  This is where we see that.
[4059.88s -> 4061.74s]  This is where you improve the most, right?
[4062.26s -> 4063.22s]  We might be wrong.
[4063.30s -> 4069.36s]  And maybe in 20 years, 30 years, we might be talking about their different methodologies of training or different understanding.
[4069.62s -> 4069.86s]  Sure.
[4070.00s -> 4070.52s]  Of course.
[4070.68s -> 4070.88s]  Right.
[4070.98s -> 4071.64s]  Things evolve.
[4071.90s -> 4083.34s]  But that's my experience that has been working very successfully with elite athletes, with some of the best athletes in the world, as well as at a clinical level.
[4083.34s -> 4088.34s]  I've had a very good experiences with people with chronic diseases when it comes to exercise prescription.
[4088.34s -> 4112.60s]  I want to get into all of the practical elements of, of zone two, and we can perhaps kind of further define it, but just quickly to close off on this conversation about lactate clearance on the MCT four side of things and the stimulus to, to activate the fast twitch muscle fibers and increase MCT four.
[4112.60s -> 4116.14s]  So you're better at clearing lactate from those muscle cells.
[4116.14s -> 4117.60s]  Are we talking about zone?
[4118.34s -> 4121.38s]  Zone four slash zone five training here.
[4121.84s -> 4122.28s]  Exactly.
[4122.50s -> 4122.70s]  Yeah.
[4122.72s -> 4126.56s]  This is where you, you have to stimulate the, the, the, the turbo, right?
[4126.60s -> 4128.68s]  That glycolytic capacity, right?
[4128.68s -> 4135.50s]  So, uh, that, that's where you improve, uh, not only just the glycolytic pathway, the whole glycolysis, right?
[4135.52s -> 4137.60s]  Which is faster and more efficient, right?
[4137.66s -> 4139.30s]  Therefore the turbo, right?
[4139.30s -> 4147.64s]  But he also improved those MCT ones because I mean, lactate is the mandatory, obligatory by-product of glucose.
[4147.64s -> 4151.84s]  Utilization, the more glucose you use, the more lactate you produce.
[4151.84s -> 4159.58s]  So that's where, like when you stimulate that energy system, you're going to use a lot of glucose and you're going to produce a lot of lactate.
[4159.58s -> 4163.64s]  And that lactate has to be shuttled out of that fast twitch cell.
[4163.64s -> 4172.90s]  And, and the way that is through the MCT force, um, and he shuttled into the adjacent cell and as long as the, and this is why it's very important.
[4172.90s -> 4175.40s]  I always say that for, for performance, right?
[4175.40s -> 4183.32s]  For those athletes, you know, you win the races or, or the competitions in the high intensity levels, obviously, right?
[4183.32s -> 4199.52s]  But because you produce so much lactate, you, you really need, you depend on, on that mitochondria of the slow twitch muscle fibers, because that's where you're going to be shuttling the lactate into for lactate cleanse capacity, as well as for fuel, right?
[4199.64s -> 4203.56s]  Uh, and so that the turbo keeps working better and better and better, right?
[4204.06s -> 4205.02s]  And this is what we see.
[4205.40s -> 4213.92s]  That as, as an athlete increases performance, let's say at 350 Watts, which for more models, it's almost impossible.
[4213.92s -> 4228.92s]  You need to turn the pedals, uh, 350 Watts, uh, an athlete today might have a blood lactate of, of, of eight millimoles and maybe one year specifically working to improve, uh, lactate cleanse capacity.
[4229.28s -> 4235.32s]  That lactate from eight millimoles is going to go to a four millimoles, maybe a 350.
[4235.40s -> 4242.56s]  So that, that athlete can sustain that intensity that before was only sustainable for three minutes or so.
[4242.66s -> 4247.16s]  Now that athlete can sustain an intensity for 40 minutes, for example, right?
[4247.16s -> 4249.42s]  So that's absolutely key to performance.
[4250.00s -> 4264.40s]  And at the same time for the everyday person, should they do a protocol that lowers their lactate in that way for a given intensity, that again is a window into mitochondrial function, which, which speaks to their metabolic health and risk of cardiometabolic.
[4264.40s -> 4264.84s]  Right.
[4265.40s -> 4266.32s]  Disease.
[4266.32s -> 4276.84s]  So there's a benefit of for grabs here for the athlete that's looking to race better, but also for the everyday person who's just looking to sort of live better for longer.
[4277.36s -> 4295.16s]  Now, I think this is really, really helpful in a go in terms of in my undergraduate, I remember one of my lecturers is sort of just bolding and underlining this statement of structure reflects function and speak, speaking to the importance of, you know, specific.
[4295.16s -> 4298.40s]  Stimuli to create a very specific adaptation.
[4298.40s -> 4302.38s]  So I think you've stepped us through really, really nicely.
[4302.68s -> 4318.74s]  The different stimulus that is kind of zone two training, which is mostly targeting slow twitch muscle fibers, zone five or zone four, five, the fast switch muscle fibers, but the way that these can kind of work together to improve metabolic health and performance.
[4319.74s -> 4324.74s]  A lot of people speak about an 80, 20 split, 80% of time in zone.
[4325.16s -> 4330.38s]  Zone two, 20% of time at zone four, five, high intensity work.
[4330.38s -> 4334.14s]  And that's commonly something said, I guess, within the endurance community.
[4334.36s -> 4346.52s]  Is that, is that a kind of rule or protocol that you also recommend both for an athlete and also for the everyday person just looking to improve their metabolic function?
[4347.40s -> 4347.56s]  Yeah.
[4347.60s -> 4354.04s]  I mean, that's part of the polarized training that it's, it's, it's been trending right for, for, for a while.
[4354.20s -> 4354.84s]  And I,
[4354.84s -> 4355.02s]  I,
[4355.16s -> 4355.62s]  I embrace it.
[4355.72s -> 4360.56s]  I particularly embrace it because this is actually what we do with athletes.
[4361.58s -> 4364.50s]  If you look at, and this is counterintuitive, right.
[4364.60s -> 4378.90s]  And, but if you look at the percentage of a workload of an athlete throughout an entire year, it doesn't matter if that athlete is a, like a, like a marathon runner, right.
[4378.90s -> 4384.84s]  Or, or, or a triathlete or a cyclist who's more pure endurance, or that athlete is a swimmer.
[4384.84s -> 4385.52s]  Right.
[4385.52s -> 4387.78s]  Or a rower, which is really high intensity.
[4388.38s -> 4397.08s]  The immense majority of the entire workload of that athlete throughout the year is in the lower intensities, more in the zone two, in the zone one.
[4397.76s -> 4397.88s]  Right.
[4398.88s -> 4402.52s]  And a very small percentage is in the very high intensities.
[4403.72s -> 4403.92s]  Right.
[4403.96s -> 4406.50s]  And this is something that we can see this very well nowadays.
[4407.18s -> 4410.30s]  We have all these platforms where we capture the information.
[4410.80s -> 4411.02s]  Right.
[4411.50s -> 4414.64s]  Where we see this in these individual athletes, team sports.
[4414.84s -> 4424.20s]  Are a little bit different because it's, it's high intensity of the time mixed with lower intensity, but in the individual sports, we see this all the time.
[4424.58s -> 4428.82s]  And, and yeah, so that's works that, that works.
[4428.82s -> 4442.14s]  And, and, and, and, and it also is necessary because if, if the, the conception that many people still have that elite athletes, they train hard and intervals and intervals and hard all the time, that's not sustainable.
[4442.48s -> 4443.60s]  That's not sustainable.
[4443.60s -> 4444.38s]  And in fact.
[4444.84s -> 4457.74s]  We really are careful with athletes with, when we prescribe intervals because yeah, it, it, it, it can put you in a very dangerous spot for overtraining and, and decreased performance.
[4458.02s -> 4459.56s]  So we really need to mitigate.
[4459.78s -> 4460.58s]  It's not sustainable.
[4460.94s -> 4464.40s]  And if you keep pushing for that, you're going to end up overtrained.
[4464.48s -> 4467.66s]  So that, that, that's where like by default.
[4468.14s -> 4472.24s]  And this is, again, this is, this is just been evolution of the sport.
[4472.24s -> 4472.52s]  Right.
[4472.52s -> 4474.82s]  I always say we cannot be so naive to think that.
[4474.84s -> 4482.46s]  The best, uh, um, uh, uh, athletes and coaches in the world, uh, over decades, they haven't thought about these concepts.
[4482.46s -> 4482.78s]  Right.
[4483.06s -> 4484.32s]  Of course they have, right.
[4484.32s -> 4487.38s]  Uh, intuitively, I'll always say a swimmer, right.
[4487.40s -> 4491.16s]  It's, uh, let's say a hundred meters swimmer is usually under a minute.
[4491.58s -> 4492.00s]  Right.
[4492.30s -> 4494.04s]  So it's super high intensity.
[4494.04s -> 4496.86s]  So intuitively what, what, what, what would a swimmer need?
[4497.24s -> 4499.32s]  Just do one minute intervals, right.
[4499.32s -> 4499.82s]  All day.
[4500.22s -> 4500.60s]  Right.
[4500.64s -> 4504.60s]  But, uh, when you see swimmers, the elite swimmers and in Australia, you guys have.
[4504.84s -> 4506.88s]  Some of the best in the world, right.
[4506.88s -> 4508.32s]  Uh, great school of swimmers.
[4508.68s -> 4512.34s]  They're swimming hours and hours and hours and hours, right.
[4512.36s -> 4518.98s]  Uh, at lower intensities, uh, what lower intensities for them, for us is unsustainable.
[4518.98s -> 4519.18s]  Right.
[4519.18s -> 4528.72s]  Because that's the other thing we haven't talked about the, um, the, the, the, what's low intensity for an athlete and what's, what's low intensity for more moral.
[4528.72s -> 4529.02s]  Right.
[4529.20s -> 4532.14s]  But for them, relatively speaking, it's a lower intensity.
[4532.46s -> 4532.76s]  Right.
[4532.76s -> 4534.62s]  And this is what w that's why they can.
[4534.62s -> 4539.48s]  Sustained hours and hours and hours, but, uh, uh, yeah, but it's contrary to it.
[4539.90s -> 4540.50s]  I understand.
[4540.50s -> 4544.34s]  I know, but that that's the way it's been the evolution of, of sports.
[4544.82s -> 4545.06s]  Okay.
[4545.06s -> 4561.92s]  So if we come back to this idea of building your aerobic base, how much of this would you say is influenced by mitochondrial function versus the amount of oxygen that we have available?
[4562.18s -> 4563.90s]  Our VO two max.
[4564.40s -> 4564.62s]  Yeah.
[4564.92s -> 4566.36s]  That's another great question.
[4566.36s -> 4571.64s]  So, um, and this is something that we have learned a lot in, in the last two or three decades.
[4572.12s -> 4578.78s]  So, um, we used to measure performance or predict performance based on VO two max.
[4579.02s -> 4579.38s]  Right.
[4579.98s -> 4593.24s]  And, uh, and it is still, it's, it's, it's a very good pro parameter because, uh, um, um, it's, it's, uh, it represents the cardio respiratory adaptations to exercise, but, um, definitely, and that's for sure.
[4593.24s -> 4594.50s]  And this, anybody can.
[4594.92s -> 4603.20s]  Who, who does a lot of testing, physiological and metabolic testing can tell you that, uh, VO two max is not, um, uh, it doesn't discriminate.
[4603.80s -> 4604.10s]  Right.
[4604.10s -> 4610.70s]  So it gets to a point that is so well expressed, uh, that, uh, it, it doesn't make the difference.
[4610.70s -> 4612.06s]  And this is what we see all the time.
[4612.06s -> 4616.04s]  You, you see two athletes with the same VO two max, right.
[4616.04s -> 4620.54s]  So therefore, um, um, yeah, they're, they supposedly are as good.
[4620.90s -> 4624.38s]  Um, and then one athlete is much better than the other.
[4625.10s -> 4625.38s]  Right.
[4625.38s -> 4628.70s]  And then you go at the cellular level, right.
[4628.76s -> 4639.24s]  Um, and then you see that, yes, at, at, uh, that, that, that athlete at 350 Watts has eight millimoles of lactate and the other one has three or four, right.
[4639.62s -> 4641.24s]  Despite of the same VO two max.
[4641.24s -> 4649.90s]  So, so this is why VO two max it's, it's, uh, it's a great surrogate for health, of course, and for fitness, no question.
[4649.98s -> 4650.30s]  Right.
[4650.72s -> 4654.60s]  But, um, you know, looking, and this is from looking.
[4654.62s -> 4658.46s]  For, from a cardiorespiratory standpoint, and this has been the norm, right.
[4658.46s -> 4659.68s]  For forever, right.
[4659.68s -> 4669.02s]  VO two max, but, uh, by looking now in, in, in the last two decades, especially at the more cellular level, we're seeing that that's what makes the difference.
[4669.06s -> 4680.50s]  And within the cellular level, uh, you know, uh, everything happens or, or the, the king of the, or, or, or the sales, uh, or the queen, because they come from the mother, we should say, right.
[4680.54s -> 4682.12s]  Um, uh, our mitochondria.
[4683.00s -> 4684.50s]  And when we're thinking about.
[4684.62s -> 4705.02s]  Stimulating the mitochondria through zone two training, are we mostly thinking about improving the function of those mitochondria, or are we also thinking about improving the number of mitochondria that are found within muscle fibers?
[4705.70s -> 4706.88s]  That's a good question too.
[4706.88s -> 4708.84s]  And, and it's, it's usually both, right.
[4708.84s -> 4713.24s]  So we improve both the number and the function, uh, of mitochondria.
[4713.74s -> 4714.50s]  Um.
[4714.62s -> 4727.56s]  Uh, definitely, I, I, I, I believe, and this is what we still need to do more and more research because there, there are different studies showing things, you know, but, uh, I think that, uh, in my humble opinion is more the function.
[4728.38s -> 4731.26s]  Uh, but they, they usually go together, right.
[4731.30s -> 4741.98s]  Uh, you see mitochondrial content in type two diabetics or obese individuals is significantly lower than in, in moderately active individuals.
[4742.38s -> 4744.54s]  And when you put, uh, those, um.
[4745.16s -> 4752.94s]  Um, those athletes, um, to, uh, there, there is this great researcher that, uh, was from Pittsburgh, uh, Toledo, Toledo.
[4753.32s -> 4758.42s]  He started doing, uh, these studies where, uh, with mitochondrial function, that was 20 years ago.
[4758.90s -> 4767.06s]  Uh, but not many people listen to him, but he was looking at, uh, people with obesity and looking at the mitochondrial content in the muscle.
[4767.06s -> 4774.38s]  And after, um, I believe was like, forgot six months or five months of aerobic training back in the days, they still talk about aerobic training.
[4774.62s -> 4776.30s]  Uh, we, we still do, right.
[4776.72s -> 4781.54s]  Uh, they improve their, uh, they, they, they triple the number of mitochondria.
[4781.90s -> 4789.58s]  So in the same way that you reduce the number by being sedentary, you can increase the number of mitochondria and the size.
[4789.58s -> 4796.44s]  They triple the number and the size of mitochondria and, and, and the function also was significantly improved.
[4796.44s -> 4798.16s]  So all things come together.
[4798.84s -> 4799.32s]  Yeah.
[4799.42s -> 4802.62s]  So that's worth sort of under, underlining that.
[4803.16s -> 4804.54s]  We're not born with.
[4804.62s -> 4807.68s]  A set number of mitochondria that's fixed for life.
[4807.68s -> 4809.24s]  We can do something about this.
[4809.54s -> 4819.74s]  And if I heard correctly, if we've lived one, two, three decades, uh, living a very sedentary lifestyle and lost a bunch of mitochondria, if we then.
[4820.40s -> 4827.02s]  Commence exercise, particularly specific exercise and do the right dose and frequency, which we'll get into.
[4827.42s -> 4831.72s]  We can actually build new mitochondria and bring some of these back.
[4832.82s -> 4833.80s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[4833.86s -> 4834.52s]  And, you know, and.
[4834.52s -> 4837.28s]  This comes within the plasticity of skeletal muscle.
[4837.28s -> 4840.22s]  I mean, we're still focusing on skeletal muscle, right?
[4840.58s -> 4848.14s]  Although it happens also in the heart and in the brain too, but, uh, the, the plasticity of skeletal muscle is extraordinary.
[4848.62s -> 4851.92s]  So, uh, uh, yeah, it can deteriorate.
[4852.54s -> 4853.64s]  Uh, over time for sure.
[4853.64s -> 4864.10s]  And it will, if you don't do exercise and something that we see on the outside of, of people who don't exercise, but, uh, also it can improve significantly over time.
[4864.10s -> 4864.40s]  As we.
[4864.40s -> 4870.76s]  See also, uh, you know, from the outside of people, you know, but imagine what happens in the inside, right.
[4870.76s -> 4872.00s]  Uh, at the cellular level.
[4872.32s -> 4872.52s]  Yeah.
[4872.52s -> 4877.66s]  There's an incredible amount of, uh, improvements that happened, uh, at the cellular level.
[4877.66s -> 4878.22s]  So, yeah.
[4878.22s -> 4887.50s]  And it comes because yeah, that, uh, the body at the end of the day is very wise and, uh, we, uh, humans, we haven't evolved to become sedentary.
[4888.04s -> 4894.22s]  Uh, we are, uh, our genes, uh, are still, um, you know.
[4894.22s -> 4897.44s]  Are still made to be active, right.
[4897.44s -> 4904.76s]  And being sedentary has been, um, a byproduct of progress as supposed to be the norm.
[4904.92s -> 4920.84s]  But, uh, unfortunately we've been growing, uh, you know, with this notion then, then, and then being sedentary or healthy sedentary has been the norm and, and doing physical and being physically activist is being the control, right.
[4920.84s -> 4922.52s]  Or it's an intervention.
[4922.58s -> 4922.90s]  Right.
[4922.90s -> 4924.14s]  Well, that, the real intervention.
[4924.22s -> 4930.24s]  for us humans as part of the evolution has been to become sedentary,
[4930.44s -> 4932.48s]  which is leading to disease, you know.
[4932.90s -> 4934.26s]  So this is what I got.
[4934.36s -> 4939.00s]  Yeah, so a lot of our research data in medical research for decades,
[4939.00s -> 4943.50s]  they've been using as a control the healthy sedentary individuals
[4943.50s -> 4947.30s]  when we know that the immense majority of those healthy sedentary,
[4948.28s -> 4952.90s]  they are going to become populations with diseases.
[4952.90s -> 4956.00s]  And we already, we have a very interesting study
[4956.00s -> 4959.50s]  that we are putting the manuscript together
[4959.50s -> 4965.06s]  with really cool findings of sedentary people who are healthy.
[4965.78s -> 4967.98s]  They don't have any clinical conditions
[4967.98s -> 4971.94s]  and they already have significant metabolic dysregulations
[4971.94s -> 4977.84s]  compared to people who are active, moderately active, not elite athletes.
[4977.84s -> 4982.74s]  So we're already seeing that 15, 20 years probably before
[4982.74s -> 4982.88s]  the development of the disease,
[4982.90s -> 4984.90s]  they have some disease.
[4985.36s -> 4989.76s]  We already see signatures, markers of metabolic dysfunction
[4989.76s -> 4991.14s]  and mitochondrial decay.
[4991.96s -> 4994.70s]  Right, and one of those, I'm assuming,
[4994.98s -> 4999.66s]  being lactate as an early predictor of disease.
[5000.70s -> 5003.52s]  Yeah, yeah, lactate is an early predictor.
[5003.96s -> 5006.84s]  We're looking at doing this by looking at different markers
[5006.84s -> 5011.72s]  in the muscle, doing muscle biopsies, right, and metabolomics.
[5012.04s -> 5012.74s]  We're looking at, you know,
[5012.74s -> 5017.04s]  look at a lot of metabolites that are happening in mitochondria
[5017.04s -> 5020.62s]  and looking itself at mitochondrial function, right,
[5020.70s -> 5024.26s]  where we do is like we get a muscle biopsy
[5024.26s -> 5030.28s]  and we inject it, we homogenize the mitochondria
[5030.28s -> 5033.84s]  of those subjects and we directly inject
[5033.84s -> 5035.80s]  in mitochondria different substrates.
[5035.80s -> 5040.54s]  We inject fatty acids, we inject carbohydrates, amino acids,
[5040.74s -> 5041.80s]  and we see how mitochondria,
[5042.74s -> 5044.12s]  metabolize those, right?
[5044.20s -> 5047.42s]  So we see there are significant differences already
[5047.42s -> 5050.80s]  in sedentary individuals.
[5051.08s -> 5054.16s]  And then also some transporters that I cannot say yet
[5054.16s -> 5056.68s]  until we don't publish it, but there's a key transporter
[5056.68s -> 5060.94s]  that is significantly downregulated
[5060.94s -> 5065.28s]  that can be 10 years, 15 years ahead of type 2 diabetes.
[5065.88s -> 5069.56s]  That is already a signature and could be a hallmark
[5069.56s -> 5071.98s]  of this population who are sedentary.
[5072.74s -> 5073.58s]  That's exciting.
[5073.58s -> 5075.24s]  It sounds very promising.
[5075.24s -> 5077.14s]  I look forward to reading about that.
[5077.36s -> 5079.06s]  What you were talking about earlier
[5079.28s -> 5081.84s]  about the sedentary lifestyles we're living
[5081.84s -> 5086.02s]  and the deterioration that occurs with that reminds me
[5086.02s -> 5087.80s]  of a quote from Frank Booth.
[5088.30s -> 5091.26s]  I'm sure you know him or have come across his work.
[5092.02s -> 5098.60s]  He said that the current human genome requires and expects us
[5098.60s -> 5101.18s]  to be physically active for normal functioning.
[5101.66s -> 5102.60s]  And, you know, I think it's important, you know,
[5102.60s -> 5105.30s]  and I think a prior guest, Paul Taylor,
[5105.42s -> 5108.84s]  shared that with me on my show, and it's kind of stuck in my mind.
[5108.84s -> 5114.82s]  We have already great examples of very primitive civilizations
[5114.82s -> 5117.40s]  that still exist in our world.
[5118.02s -> 5122.00s]  And there's, so there are especially two populations,
[5122.50s -> 5125.76s]  the Hazda hunter-gatherers in Tanzania,
[5126.54s -> 5130.08s]  and also the Tsimane hunter-gatherer population
[5130.08s -> 5131.72s]  in Bolivia, right?
[5131.82s -> 5132.04s]  Right.
[5132.04s -> 5132.06s]  Right.
[5132.06s -> 5132.12s]  Right.
[5132.12s -> 5132.14s]  Right.
[5132.14s -> 5132.16s]  Right.
[5132.16s -> 5132.18s]  Right.
[5132.18s -> 5132.20s]  Right.
[5132.20s -> 5132.22s]  Right.
[5132.22s -> 5132.24s]  Right.
[5132.24s -> 5132.30s]  Right.
[5132.30s -> 5132.32s]  Right.
[5132.32s -> 5132.34s]  Right.
[5132.34s -> 5132.58s]  Right.
[5132.60s -> 5132.72s]  Right.
[5132.72s -> 5132.76s]  Right.
[5132.76s -> 5132.82s]  Right.
[5132.96s -> 5136.32s]  Primitive populations, they don't have any contact
[5136.32s -> 5140.42s]  or they haven't had any contact forever with civilization.
[5140.84s -> 5141.92s]  They haven't even evolved.
[5142.72s -> 5146.74s]  They have the same tools and the same dresses
[5146.74s -> 5149.60s]  as they had, you know, like a thousand years ago,
[5149.72s -> 5151.10s]  2,000 years ago, right?
[5152.24s -> 5156.44s]  So, and then there are a few researchers.
[5157.44s -> 5162.06s]  There are two, especially a punter,
[5162.06s -> 5170.04s]  and Kaplan, who just went into these tribes and started to study the incidence of diseases,
[5170.66s -> 5178.10s]  as well as obesity, body fat percentage, their habits, how much time they were exercising a day,
[5178.62s -> 5185.22s]  and as well as what was their nutrition. So those are the real primitive civilizations, right?
[5185.22s -> 5195.38s]  So the rate of obesity among these populations was about 2%. We're talking about now overweight
[5195.38s -> 5203.70s]  or obesity in our Western, or not Western, our civilized world, right? It's somewhere between 50
[5203.70s -> 5212.28s]  and 70%, right? Type 2 diabetes in this population was 1%. We're talking that in the US alone,
[5212.60s -> 5214.24s]  52% of...
[5215.22s -> 5224.14s]  Adults are pre-diabetic or diabetic already, right? And I always say that being pre-diabetic,
[5224.38s -> 5230.60s]  you already have the disease. There's no term such as being pre-pregnant or pregnant. You're
[5230.60s -> 5235.52s]  pregnant or you're not, right? So the same thing with pre-diabetes. They also have the lowest
[5235.52s -> 5242.48s]  cardiovascular disease in atherosclerosis plaque percentage observed in any humans in the world,
[5242.48s -> 5244.98s]  right? And the life expectancy,
[5245.22s -> 5252.48s]  in fact, similar to the US. The problem that they have is that the majority of fatalities
[5252.48s -> 5258.50s]  that they have, about 70% of fatalities are due to infections. They don't have medications. They
[5258.50s -> 5264.58s]  don't have antibiotics, right? And then they have a lot of fatalities due to trauma, accidents,
[5264.80s -> 5272.34s]  right? But only about 10% of their deaths are due to non-communicable diseases, whereas in our
[5272.34s -> 5274.14s]  population, there's about 70%.
[5275.22s -> 5281.62s]  Right? Due to non-communicable diseases. And then the habits of these people,
[5282.74s -> 5291.74s]  they're walking between 110 and 135, 140 minutes a day. So the American Heart Association,
[5291.96s -> 5297.04s]  American Medical Association, American... I mean, all these associations, they're saying about the
[5297.04s -> 5304.22s]  150 minutes a week, right? That's pretty much what they do a day, right? And then we look at their
[5304.22s -> 5304.66s]  diet.
[5305.22s -> 5312.44s]  And they're pretty much plant-based diet. They're hunter-gathered populations. They hunt whenever
[5312.44s -> 5318.08s]  they can, probably like the people in the Paleolithic, right? We have the idea that people
[5318.08s -> 5326.26s]  in the Paleolithic, all they were sick, I mean, 180 meters or six foot tall and super strong,
[5326.34s -> 5333.00s]  you know, and they could hold a bear with one hand and a lion with the other one and eat him
[5333.00s -> 5335.20s]  alive, right? That's probably not true, right? They were all sick. They were all sick. They were
[5335.20s -> 5342.54s]  probably very slim, very fragile people who were to survive and didn't have the strength to
[5342.54s -> 5348.62s]  overtake a lion or a bear, right? But yeah, they were hunter-gatherers. They could hunt whenever
[5348.62s -> 5355.72s]  they could. But in the meantime, hey, they had a plant-based diet. And the diet in these people
[5355.72s -> 5365.12s]  is somewhere between 65% and 70% in carbohydrates, right? Which is about 30% to 35%
[5365.20s -> 5374.54s]  higher than the U.S. in carbohydrates. And they have about 15%, 25% protein and only about 10%,
[5374.54s -> 5386.42s]  14% fat. So this is the paradox, right, of these populations who have almost non-existent levels
[5386.42s -> 5392.66s]  of obesity, of type 2 diabetes, of cardiovascular disease, and yet they have very high
[5392.66s -> 5395.18s]  consumption.
[5395.20s -> 5404.98s]  Yeah, it sort of puts to rest this idea that carbohydrates or glucose are inherently bad
[5404.98s -> 5411.24s]  for metabolic health. That must be something that you, as someone who is so close with the
[5411.24s -> 5415.08s]  research in this area and conducting your own studies, you must shake your head when you come
[5415.08s -> 5416.46s]  across those sort of claims.
[5417.44s -> 5423.20s]  Yeah, and I always go back to the same thing. It's just like, yeah, if you don't have good
[5423.20s -> 5425.18s]  function in mitochondria, you're not going to be able to do anything.
[5425.20s -> 5430.88s]  And if you have carbohydrates, that's bad. That's, as I said earlier, that's adding gas to the fire.
[5431.20s -> 5435.82s]  That's going to make your condition worse because you need to metabolize it. And therefore, yes,
[5435.92s -> 5444.64s]  for someone with a poor mitochondrial function, maybe a more protein-based diet and carbohydrate
[5444.64s -> 5452.16s]  reducing it is needed, right? But if you are a healthy individual, you exercise, you're good,
[5452.16s -> 5454.94s]  you know, like these populations that I described, right?
[5455.20s -> 5462.56s]  They do in one day, what is the recommended for in our civilization for one week, which by the way,
[5462.56s -> 5469.24s]  very few individuals get to meet the 150 minutes required per week, right? So these people,
[5469.42s -> 5475.12s]  I would love at some point to travel to these areas and do a muscle biopsy of these populations
[5475.12s -> 5480.86s]  and see their mitochondrial function, because I'm very sure it's going to resemble a lot to those
[5480.86s -> 5485.18s]  that we see in, you know, very fit.
[5485.20s -> 5492.10s]  Individuals who exercise a lot and they have the same eating habits, right? Eating a high
[5492.10s -> 5498.60s]  carbohydrate diet, low fat and moderating protein. I'm glad that you brought up that point about
[5498.60s -> 5505.32s]  pre-diabetes. And I think that's another one worth kind of underlining that metabolic health
[5505.32s -> 5512.96s]  or metabolic disease and dysfunction, I should say, is it's more of a spectrum, would you agree?
[5514.02s -> 5515.12s]  So it's not...
[5515.20s -> 5521.70s]  It's not as though you go from being metabolically healthy to the next moment being diagnosed
[5521.70s -> 5528.24s]  with type 2 diabetes. So if someone's listening today and is thinking, well, I live a pretty
[5528.24s -> 5534.88s]  sedentary lifestyle, but I don't have type 2 diabetes, what you're saying is, despite
[5534.88s -> 5540.16s]  the fact that you haven't been diagnosed with a metabolic condition, if we were to take
[5540.16s -> 5544.02s]  out the microscope, we took a biopsy of your muscle tissue, we would be able to identify
[5544.02s -> 5545.02s]  that.
[5545.02s -> 5552.04s]  We would be able to identify that there is decay, deterioration, occurring mitochondrial
[5552.04s -> 5559.76s]  dysfunction, and you are on the path to metabolic disease, despite not currently having it.
[5560.46s -> 5567.84s]  Yes, without a doubt. And yeah, and exactly. And this is why, yeah, just sedentary individuals,
[5567.84s -> 5574.90s]  even though they're healthy now, the majority are going to encounter cardiometabolic disease in the
[5575.02s -> 5579.02s]  form of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, both. They're going to have a higher chances
[5579.02s -> 5584.06s]  of developing cancers. There's more and more data around cancer. At this point, there's
[5584.06s -> 5591.76s]  a lot of epidemiological data, more than scientific cellular data, of what being sedentary does
[5591.76s -> 5603.88s]  to you, or obese, right? So being obese or being sedentary, it can increase about 50%
[5603.88s -> 5604.72s]  chances.
[5605.02s -> 5607.16s]  And so what we're trying to do is, we're trying to find out the causes of many cancers, right?
[5607.16s -> 5612.78s]  So that's absolutely astronomical, right? But we're still trying to find out that more,
[5612.78s -> 5621.78s]  right? But yes, we know that also Alzheimer's, people who are sedentary, they have higher
[5621.78s -> 5627.80s]  risk for Alzheimer's and old time disease, you know? And this is also, you and I were,
[5627.80s -> 5633.08s]  you sent me yesterday an article, right, about cardiorespiratory fitness, right? And cardiorespiratory
[5633.08s -> 5634.08s]  fitness.
[5634.08s -> 5641.14s]  It's highly associated to a high risk of full-cause mortality, more than any other disease.
[5641.14s -> 5642.14s]  Yeah.
[5642.14s -> 5647.56s]  In that paper that I sent you, there was a bunch of really interesting findings. Some
[5647.56s -> 5655.06s]  that stood out to me were the fact that the higher the subjects' cardiorespiratory fitness
[5655.06s -> 5661.60s]  in that paper, and that paper was looking at, I believe, over 700,000 US veterans, but
[5661.60s -> 5662.12s]  the higher their fitness level was all the way up to, you know, the 80,000, you know,
[5662.12s -> 5663.12s]  the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know,
[5663.12s -> 5664.04s]  the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the
[5664.04s -> 5665.04s]  80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the 80,000, you know, the
[5665.04s -> 5666.04s]  80,000, you know, the 80% of that in the data, it was D.
[5666.04s -> 5685.96s]  There was a lot of
[5685.96s -> 5687.54s]  figures that wereomoved currently question sch usage.
[5687.54s -> 5688.50s]  So I'm going to get over here.
[5688.50s -> 5689.64s]  We're in the입니다 deployment.
[5689.64s -> 5692.02s]  And the that's the estimate that the data that data came from is an estimate that dropping
[5692.02s -> 5693.10s]  to the 13- Excel look at this example here, Korab ofember yeah.
[5693.10s -> 5693.90s]  That was poison.
[5693.90s -> 5699.52s]  would half someone's risk of premature death, again, just going from low fitness to just
[5699.52s -> 5705.70s]  moderate, and that that could probably be achieved with 150 minutes of moderate intensity
[5705.70s -> 5709.72s]  cardiovascular training a week or zone two training.
[5710.74s -> 5711.40s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[5711.40s -> 5718.02s]  And I've seen, I'll tell you like an example that it's incredibly inspiring and it was
[5718.02s -> 5720.48s]  even hard, it was very hard to believe, but it's true.
[5720.48s -> 5730.82s]  So I tested once in the laboratory, an 81-year-old gentleman who was world champion, cycling
[5730.82s -> 5737.20s]  world champion of the 80 to 85-year-old bracket, which believe me, it exists, right?
[5737.36s -> 5739.04s]  Which is great to see, right?
[5739.14s -> 5747.56s]  So anyways, I was fascinated because his metabolism, his metabolic efficiency during the test that
[5747.56s -> 5750.46s]  I do was that of someone in their 30.
[5750.48s -> 5753.54s]  Or 40s, healthy and active, right?
[5753.62s -> 5755.02s]  It was unbelievable.
[5755.34s -> 5759.02s]  I keep that test like a treasure, right?
[5759.06s -> 5762.86s]  Because it's an absolute treasure to see those adaptations, right?
[5763.42s -> 5769.96s]  So anyways, right away, I thought, boy, you've been doing sports all your life, right?
[5770.04s -> 5772.80s]  So man, you chose the right lifestyle, right?
[5773.08s -> 5779.52s]  And he told me, actually, no, actually, until I was in the early 50s, I was obese, I was
[5779.52s -> 5780.16s]  hypertensive.
[5780.48s -> 5781.56s]  I used to smoke.
[5782.50s -> 5784.12s]  I had a very poor lifestyle.
[5784.30s -> 5785.46s]  I didn't exercise at all.
[5786.00s -> 5790.46s]  And one day, I started to ride and bike and think about life and things like that.
[5790.52s -> 5791.54s]  And ever since then.
[5792.04s -> 5794.22s]  So to your point, what you said, right?
[5794.22s -> 5802.76s]  This was an individual, the early 50s, sedentary, very poor, healthy lifestyle.
[5803.04s -> 5810.46s]  And then, boom, 30 years later, at 81 years old, his metabolic health was that of someone
[5810.46s -> 5815.00s]  in their 30s whose health was unbelievable, hard to believe.
[5815.00s -> 5821.58s]  And this is how that person, obviously, 81-year-old, that's an example of what exercise can do
[5821.58s -> 5823.28s]  for your longevity, right?
[5823.50s -> 5827.92s]  That person was not on any medication at 81 years old.
[5828.24s -> 5830.56s]  And it was a fit, slim individual.
[5830.72s -> 5831.44s]  It was hard to believe.
[5831.80s -> 5838.02s]  But hey, this is how the magic of exercise, right, is if we were able to put exercise
[5838.02s -> 5839.64s]  in a pill, right?
[5839.66s -> 5840.44s]  And take it every day.
[5840.44s -> 5844.90s]  It would be the most sold medication in the history, right?
[5846.14s -> 5847.26s]  But that's another point.
[5847.66s -> 5853.88s]  That's a very hopeful, promising message, story for people to hear.
[5854.14s -> 5862.86s]  And I guess speaks to the incredible capacity for the human body to adapt should you provide
[5862.86s -> 5865.70s]  the right stimulus at any point in time.
[5865.82s -> 5868.56s]  And that it's never too late to get started.
[5868.56s -> 5870.40s]  And 42.
[5870.44s -> 5872.56s]  Your point, it's in our genes, right?
[5872.66s -> 5874.24s]  And what we say, it's embedded in our genes.
[5874.34s -> 5875.38s]  So we have the genes.
[5875.56s -> 5881.76s]  Humans, our genes, maybe in 10,000 years, our genes will evolve to be sedentary.
[5882.10s -> 5885.86s]  I don't think we'll be around in 10,000 years because we're so dumb in the first place,
[5885.90s -> 5886.12s]  right?
[5886.64s -> 5891.90s]  But if we were around, maybe our genes, they adapt to become sedentary.
[5891.90s -> 5899.88s]  But at this point, we're too young as a race, as a species for our genes to adapt to become
[5899.88s -> 5900.42s]  sedentary.
[5900.56s -> 5904.86s]  So they're ready to get the ball rolling with exercise anytime.
[5905.66s -> 5909.74s]  I have mixed feelings about that because I love moving my body.
[5911.30s -> 5916.66s]  Hey, friends, if you'd like to stay connected and reinforce the valuable insights from this
[5916.66s -> 5918.54s]  show, let's connect on Instagram.
[5918.94s -> 5920.78s]  You can find me at Simon Hill.
[5921.04s -> 5922.64s]  That's at Simon Hill.
[5922.94s -> 5924.24s]  I look forward to seeing you there.
[5924.50s -> 5926.62s]  All right, let's dive back into the episode.
[5926.98s -> 5930.22s]  I think it would be a good point now for us to...
[5930.44s -> 5936.78s]  To sort of double click on Zone 2 and explain to people how they can set this up in their
[5936.78s -> 5943.62s]  own life, how they can know that they're in Zone 2 and how much Zone 2 training they should
[5943.62s -> 5949.10s]  be sort of targeting or working towards on a weekly basis in order to provide enough
[5949.10s -> 5954.38s]  stimulus to get these adaptations happening that we've been talking about and then reap
[5954.38s -> 5956.98s]  the benefits from improved metabolic health.
[5957.86s -> 5959.70s]  Just quickly before we...
[5959.70s -> 5962.68s]  We get there, you mentioned Herman Ponser.
[5962.78s -> 5967.08s]  Just as a reminder to the listeners, Herman Ponser was on the show a little while back,
[5967.14s -> 5970.14s]  so you can go back and listen to that episode and hear all about the hard stuff.
[5970.36s -> 5970.38s]  Oh, yeah.
[5970.38s -> 5971.62s]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[5972.34s -> 5974.36s]  Yeah, so that was great that you mentioned him.
[5974.44s -> 5978.88s]  And his book, Burn, is a really good read for anyone that wants to kind of deep dive
[5978.88s -> 5981.66s]  his work with the hard stuff.
[5982.70s -> 5986.24s]  Zone 2, Inigo, let's define it.
[5986.24s -> 5988.28s]  I know we probably have earlier in the conversation.
[5989.00s -> 5989.54s]  But simple definition.
[5989.70s -> 5993.02s]  What does Zone 2 actually mean?
[5994.24s -> 5999.14s]  So, again, there are probably different definitions.
[5999.58s -> 6000.66s]  Some of them are closer.
[6000.82s -> 6002.22s]  Other ones are a little bit more separate.
[6002.44s -> 6007.82s]  I just have my own definition, right, that I've been using for 30 years.
[6008.00s -> 6016.00s]  And for me, that's the exercise intensity where someone can improve mitochondrial function
[6016.00s -> 6016.70s]  the most.
[6017.10s -> 6018.44s]  Not the only one.
[6018.82s -> 6019.54s]  Not the only zone.
[6019.70s -> 6022.00s]  Because other zones are going to always be beneficial.
[6022.48s -> 6023.64s]  Any zone would be beneficial.
[6024.42s -> 6030.20s]  But from what I've seen is looking at fat oxidation in the laboratory in lactate,
[6030.20s -> 6035.88s]  cleansed capacity, as mitochondrial substrates, and therefore, surrogates for function.
[6036.34s -> 6037.08s]  That's what I see.
[6038.22s -> 6045.62s]  And, yeah, that's how I kind of define, in a nutshell, Zone 2.
[6046.24s -> 6049.28s]  I think many of the listeners will be thinking,
[6049.70s -> 6053.28s]  how do I know that I'm in Zone 2?
[6054.28s -> 6057.74s]  And there are a lot of different calculations online.
[6058.42s -> 6060.16s]  There are running tests.
[6060.44s -> 6062.16s]  There are lab tests, et cetera.
[6062.16s -> 6065.26s]  How do you encourage people to think about this?
[6065.88s -> 6066.96s]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[6067.44s -> 6074.56s]  So, I think that as we're starting to look at exercise prescription for the mass market
[6074.56s -> 6079.06s]  and for many people, as opposed to just two elite athletes, right, we're going to see
[6079.06s -> 6079.66s]  more and more.
[6079.70s -> 6084.10s]  More and more exercise physiology or metabolic laboratories around the world, right?
[6084.66s -> 6086.70s]  And, in fact, it's happening, right?
[6086.74s -> 6094.52s]  Until recently, there were very few laboratories around the world who did this test to specifically
[6094.52s -> 6099.76s]  find out your training intensities, right, based on heart rate or power output, right?
[6100.20s -> 6102.68s]  And they were only for the elite athletes, right?
[6102.68s -> 6109.38s]  And then now more and more are popping up around the world.
[6110.06s -> 6114.82s]  And people are not so scared to go to a laboratory because I remember when I started doing this
[6114.82s -> 6122.28s]  in the U.S. for health purposes with patients 15 years ago, people were scared because they
[6122.28s -> 6124.42s]  said, oh, I'm not an elite athlete, right?
[6124.84s -> 6130.16s]  Or they would see a cycling jersey of a runner's jersey on the wall and say, I'm not one of
[6130.16s -> 6130.76s]  those, right?
[6131.20s -> 6132.96s]  No, but this is not about that, right?
[6132.96s -> 6133.88s]  This is about you.
[6134.50s -> 6139.36s]  And so, anyways, those laboratories and those testing, they're becoming more sophisticated.
[6139.70s -> 6144.44s]  And people running those tests, there are more and more professionals.
[6145.08s -> 6149.80s]  Before, there were not that many professionals working in this area and that people would
[6149.80s -> 6151.18s]  go to their local university.
[6151.90s -> 6158.14s]  And with all the respects to graduating undergrad students, you know, they were seen and tested
[6158.14s -> 6159.10s]  by them, right?
[6159.22s -> 6163.62s]  Now you see a lot of professionals who they were undergrad or graduate students and be
[6163.62s -> 6164.84s]  coming to this field, right?
[6165.76s -> 6167.42s]  So that's on one hand.
[6167.42s -> 6169.52s]  But there are people out there.
[6169.70s -> 6171.86s]  They cannot find a place, right?
[6172.08s -> 6173.96s]  There's not a laboratory in their town.
[6174.22s -> 6177.10s]  Or maybe it's too expensive and they cannot afford it, right?
[6177.42s -> 6186.62s]  So for those, and from my experience, right, I think that the breathing and talk test,
[6186.88s -> 6188.62s]  it's a great way.
[6189.22s -> 6190.68s]  And I'll explain it.
[6190.68s -> 6197.28s]  So like when you and I talk like this now, when you can maintain a conversation like
[6197.28s -> 6198.90s]  this, you're in your zone one.
[6199.18s -> 6199.68s]  You're recovering.
[6200.02s -> 6202.36s]  You're not stimulating much, right?
[6202.86s -> 6210.50s]  Zone two, it would be like a hard conversation to maintain, right?
[6210.62s -> 6216.34s]  If you imagine yourself exercising with someone else, you could maintain a conversation, but
[6216.34s -> 6218.36s]  it would be costly, right?
[6218.50s -> 6222.80s]  You will be talking with some difficulty, but you could maintain it, right?
[6222.82s -> 6228.42s]  Not for a long time, not for one hour, because it would be too fastidious, right?
[6228.42s -> 6229.68s]  But you could maintain it.
[6229.92s -> 6233.02s]  That would be kind of what we see the results in the laboratory.
[6233.82s -> 6236.74s]  And it kind of corresponds to that, right?
[6237.36s -> 6244.50s]  And then zone three would be an exercise intensity where it's very difficult to maintain a conversation.
[6244.88s -> 6245.54s]  Very difficult.
[6245.54s -> 6249.90s]  Just exchange a few phrases or a few words, right?
[6250.98s -> 6253.68s]  Then zone four, no conversation.
[6253.94s -> 6254.38s]  That's it.
[6254.60s -> 6257.66s]  You know, maybe one word you can say, you know.
[6257.86s -> 6259.30s]  And then zone five and zone six.
[6259.38s -> 6259.50s]  Yeah.
[6259.70s -> 6261.42s]  There's no possibility, right?
[6261.42s -> 6267.32s]  But I think that, and I honestly, and I know it might sound old school, but we have now
[6267.32s -> 6274.96s]  watches and all these algorithms, you know, that gives us zones, you know, that the immense
[6274.96s -> 6284.20s]  majority are far away from giving you the right intensities because those algorithms
[6284.20s -> 6287.54s]  are not individualized yet.
[6287.88s -> 6289.68s]  It'll happen at some point.
[6289.70s -> 6289.92s]  Right?
[6290.00s -> 6298.32s]  But at this point, I really think that the talk and test is much more accurate than the
[6298.32s -> 6303.28s]  immense algorithms that you find out there in all these brands telling you the training
[6303.28s -> 6303.70s]  zones.
[6303.70s -> 6305.14s]  So, and it's easy to do.
[6305.26s -> 6310.96s]  And again, from my experience in the data, the hardcore data from laboratory, it's not
[6310.96s -> 6315.22s]  that matches perfectly, but it corresponds quite well.
[6315.84s -> 6315.94s]  Yeah.
[6315.98s -> 6319.04s]  And I think, you know, it's just worth us remembering.
[6319.70s -> 6323.16s]  Remembering that there are so many people living a sedentary lifestyle.
[6323.16s -> 6328.86s]  So trying to remove barriers to just get people moving is, is a great thing.
[6328.86s -> 6332.66s]  And what you've just described there is really accessible to people.
[6332.82s -> 6334.68s]  Are you a little bit puffy?
[6334.94s -> 6340.42s]  Perhaps you have a little bit of sweat happening, but you can, you can carry that conversation.
[6340.64s -> 6344.52s]  If you were on the phone to someone, they would know you're exercising, but they could
[6344.52s -> 6349.68s]  still have a bit of a conversation with you without it being sort of too inactive.
[6350.18s -> 6356.76s]  And the good thing with that too, is that as you get fitter, you can, you can be displacing
[6356.76s -> 6358.88s]  that intensity, right?
[6358.94s -> 6364.66s]  So now maybe someone is sedentary and obese or overweight, and maybe just, just walking
[6364.66s -> 6365.92s]  around the block, right?
[6366.82s -> 6368.46s]  Might be tiring, right?
[6368.82s -> 6373.86s]  But that might be the zone two, for example, but maybe in one year that person can do like
[6373.86s -> 6375.92s]  a, a breeze walk, right?
[6375.98s -> 6378.18s]  And be at that same intensity, right?
[6378.18s -> 6379.48s]  So that, that's what, uh,
[6379.70s -> 6383.46s]  you can guide yourself through this simple test, right?
[6383.46s -> 6389.56s]  Which at the same time, this zone two intensity is, it's something that's sustainable for
[6389.56s -> 6390.70s]  life, you know?
[6390.80s -> 6395.66s]  And, and, and again, I, I, I also say that any intensity will help and you need, as we
[6395.66s -> 6400.06s]  discuss higher intensity to maintain your fitness and your glycolytic capacity.
[6400.26s -> 6405.68s]  And obviously we haven't talked about, um, um, uh, resistance exercise, which is very
[6405.68s -> 6406.50s]  important, right?
[6406.50s -> 6408.50s]  And you know, more than, than I do.
[6408.50s -> 6413.46s]  Uh, uh, but the thing is like, yeah, it's just when, when, when it comes to both exercise
[6413.46s -> 6419.38s]  and diets, you know, I, I always ask people who do these extremes, extremes, exercise
[6419.38s -> 6422.60s]  routines and extreme diets, and they have great results.
[6422.80s -> 6426.60s]  The immense majority are just temporary because the immense majority go back to where they
[6426.60s -> 6426.84s]  were.
[6427.04s -> 6429.90s]  And when you ask them, can you do this for the rest of your life?
[6430.22s -> 6431.40s]  The answer is no.
[6432.02s -> 6438.20s]  So if you cannot do a diet or an exercise for the rest of your life, it's not going
[6438.20s -> 6438.48s]  to work.
[6438.66s -> 6443.48s]  So you need to have some sustainability, both in your nutrition and both in your exercise.
[6444.48s -> 6449.84s]  And when it comes to exercise, a zone two is something that anybody can, can do for
[6449.84s -> 6450.76s]  the rest of their lives.
[6451.00s -> 6457.50s]  You mentioned some of those algorithms and I think the most crude sort of calculations
[6457.50s -> 6463.46s]  that are out there are, uh, using max heart rate, 220 minus age, and then kind of just
[6463.46s -> 6467.86s]  multiplying that out by the various intensities of the different zones.
[6467.86s -> 6476.34s]  And perhaps a step better, there's calculations like the carbon and formula, which I'm sure
[6476.34s -> 6479.24s]  you're familiar with that uses heart rate reserve.
[6479.66s -> 6487.30s]  If, if someone is going to go out and use a calculation out there, it's the carbon and
[6487.30s -> 6492.32s]  sort of formula or a formula that's using heart rate reserve better than, than one that
[6492.32s -> 6493.70s]  just uses max heart rate.
[6494.34s -> 6494.98s]  Probably.
[6494.98s -> 6497.84s]  Uh, but still the things, and this is what I've also, uh, I've also, I've also, I've
[6497.86s -> 6503.30s]  also learned working with athletes, uh, and also regular people is that the heart rate
[6503.30s -> 6505.84s]  response to exercise is so individual.
[6506.32s -> 6512.78s]  You can have someone with the same, uh, age and, uh, one's maximum heart rate might be
[6512.78s -> 6516.20s]  180 and the other one might be 200, right?
[6516.28s -> 6518.60s]  Uh, or 160 and 200, right?
[6519.10s -> 6525.84s]  Um, so, and, and, and, and regarding the cardio reserve, that could vary significantly also
[6525.84s -> 6527.02s]  among individuals.
[6527.02s -> 6527.34s]  So.
[6527.86s -> 6530.94s]  I think it's probably more accurate, right?
[6531.00s -> 6537.02s]  But, uh, um, but I don't think there, we're not there yet, uh, looking into, into these
[6537.02s -> 6541.66s]  algorithms when it comes to heart rate, uh, because it varies a lot.
[6541.68s -> 6546.56s]  And I think that again, it's one of the things it doesn't represent necessarily what happens
[6546.56s -> 6547.40s]  at the cellular level.
[6547.40s -> 6554.30s]  I think that, um, uh, the, the, the future is, is going to come in the, uh, um, uh,
[6554.30s -> 6557.40s]  biosensors where we're going to be, uh.
[6557.86s -> 6563.42s]  We're working with one company with one biosensor already that we think is going to be a big
[6563.42s -> 6568.24s]  deal at some point, but the biosensors that they're, you know, kind of people have now
[6568.24s -> 6572.50s]  some glucose that if you're type one diabetes, it's, it's a game changer.
[6572.86s -> 6576.46s]  If you're not, it's cool to, to see how your glucose goes up and down.
[6576.92s -> 6582.36s]  Eventually it's physiology and metabolism one-on-one and eventually, yeah, it's just,
[6582.48s -> 6585.90s]  uh, you can get some education, but eventually you will not using it much because you're,
[6586.36s -> 6587.44s]  you're not type one.
[6587.86s -> 6593.12s]  But the more sophisticated bio, uh, biosensors are coming with more metabolites that come
[6593.12s -> 6594.44s]  directly from your cells.
[6594.84s -> 6600.66s]  And that's where you're going to be guiding, um, uh, exercise in a much, uh, specific way.
[6601.48s -> 6603.88s]  What do you think about the devices?
[6603.88s -> 6613.08s]  I sent you a few on, on email that you breathe into that sort of supposedly tell you what
[6613.08s -> 6616.24s]  type of fuel you're using to produce ATP.
[6617.86s -> 6618.94s]  Um, yes.
[6619.04s -> 6620.30s]  Uh, so those are very good.
[6620.38s -> 6623.78s]  Um, uh, that's a, that's a very good question, uh, out there.
[6624.12s -> 6630.74s]  And, uh, without a doubt it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, um, it's, it's a starting of, of,
[6630.82s -> 6636.50s]  of, of a movement of trying to understand better, uh, your, how your metabolism works.
[6636.84s -> 6637.32s]  Right.
[6637.32s -> 6645.68s]  Um, but, uh, one of the things is that they're, you know, they need to be very well calibrated.
[6646.00s -> 6647.84s]  And this is, this is my, my problem.
[6647.86s -> 6648.88s]  That I have, right.
[6648.98s -> 6655.80s]  And, and this is my, my experience from, um, uh, for 30 years, uh, working with all
[6655.80s -> 6656.72s]  these metabolic cards.
[6656.82s -> 6664.10s]  So we, we use in the laboratory metabolic cards who are like a $30,000, uh, worth very
[6664.10s -> 6665.22s]  expensive, very delicate.
[6665.22s -> 6669.00s]  And those are the state of the art and they really need to be very calibrated.
[6669.00s -> 6673.36s]  So they have CO2 sensors and, and oxygen sensors as well.
[6673.70s -> 6677.84s]  So, um, and they believe me, they get decalibrated all the time.
[6678.38s -> 6679.48s]  They're very sensitive.
[6679.48s -> 6683.54s]  So, and, and if they're not correctly calibrated or they get decalibrated, they're going to
[6683.54s -> 6685.98s]  give you false readings, which happens all the time.
[6686.18s -> 6691.90s]  And in fact, there's a brand, I don't want to name any brands, but there's a brand that
[6691.90s -> 6695.86s]  I've been using to do my research and to get these calculations all these years, which
[6695.86s -> 6696.86s]  to me is the best.
[6697.00s -> 6702.22s]  So there is the most accurate, um, and you can see the accuracy very well.
[6702.22s -> 6707.22s]  Um, but the problem is, is that, uh, it's not as fancy or has these graphs.
[6707.86s -> 6713.12s]  Uh, or hasn't evolved in 30 years, um, uh, as other brands, right?
[6713.14s -> 6718.22s]  Other brands that have these nice and fancy graphs, uh, but maybe there's not as accurate
[6718.22s -> 6719.84s]  as, as these other brands, right?
[6720.12s -> 6725.22s]  But anyways, but we're still talking about equipment that are 30, $30,000 worth, right?
[6725.62s -> 6730.28s]  But these devices are like 200, 300, 400, uh, sure.
[6730.40s -> 6733.34s]  Some of them, they have CO2 sensors, right?
[6733.38s -> 6734.26s]  And no two sensors.
[6734.44s -> 6737.68s]  But how do you know, uh, first that they're.
[6737.68s -> 6739.20s]  How do you calibrate them?
[6740.10s -> 6740.24s]  Right.
[6740.40s -> 6743.72s]  And, uh, therefore, how do you know that the readings are right?
[6743.88s -> 6747.02s]  And second, how do you know when they stop functioning?
[6747.40s -> 6753.70s]  And because we know from these very expensive cards that you need to replace the sensors
[6753.70s -> 6757.92s]  often, sometimes every year, sometimes every two years, three years.
[6757.92s -> 6758.16s]  Right.
[6758.58s -> 6762.88s]  Um, and that's the thing, you know, like, uh, I see that the concentration to, to calibrate
[6762.88s -> 6767.30s]  them, you need to, to really put our, um, uh, oxygen.
[6767.68s -> 6773.14s]  And the way they do this, when you do the calibration from ambient air, right?
[6773.22s -> 6781.00s]  The metabolic card gets oxygen and he has to read 20.94, which is the, uh, oxygen concentration.
[6781.40s -> 6785.18s]  And then CO2 is usually the one that is the most problematic.
[6785.48s -> 6788.08s]  It has to read 0.03%.
[6788.08s -> 6789.12s]  Right.
[6789.12s -> 6796.86s]  So when you calibrate those manually or automatically, uh, multiple times, you see that the CO2 concentration
[6796.86s -> 6797.12s]  is.
[6797.68s -> 6807.16s]  0.05 or 0.06 or 0.01 and the card, the metabolic card allows you to proceed with the test.
[6807.60s -> 6808.16s]  Right.
[6808.60s -> 6811.24s]  So without a doubt, you're going to have false readings.
[6811.44s -> 6816.50s]  And again, we're talking about a $30,000, very sophisticated piece of equipment.
[6816.90s -> 6822.12s]  Now, how do I know in these small devices that the reading that I have is the actual
[6822.12s -> 6823.44s]  one, right?
[6823.58s -> 6827.58s]  So that that's, and, and again, I'm not criticizing necessarily, right?
[6827.68s -> 6832.66s]  Those devices, because I think that, uh, they can give you like a trends and where
[6832.66s -> 6837.16s]  you are, you know, and, and, and if you're burning more fat or less, but I think that,
[6837.30s -> 6843.04s]  um, yes, uh, I, I, I don't know if I don't know the calibration, the precise calibration
[6843.04s -> 6848.72s]  that I, I don't, I don't trust in much, you know, and, and then you go to some of the
[6848.72s -> 6852.08s]  websites of not all, but some of these devices.
[6852.08s -> 6857.50s]  And when you, when you go to a website and you see hack your metabolism or own your metabolism,
[6857.68s -> 6863.24s]  you know, or the most advanced metabolic machinery, like I it's, it's a red flag, right?
[6863.26s -> 6865.28s]  Because there's not such thing, right?
[6865.28s -> 6867.36s]  Now you see rings, right?
[6867.50s -> 6873.22s]  That, um, they go to the website and you can, oh, the most sophisticated piece of metabolic
[6873.22s -> 6875.82s]  measurement you can have it like, come on.
[6875.84s -> 6878.04s]  It's just, it's a ring for good sakes.
[6878.70s -> 6887.46s]  That reminds me of the way kind of zone to training at max fat oxidation is often
[6887.46s -> 6896.58s]  conflated with this magical fat burning zone and, and fat loss or body fat loss.
[6896.90s -> 6902.50s]  Is that, is that something that you could clarify for the listeners?
[6903.28s -> 6903.84s]  Yes.
[6903.92s -> 6908.16s]  And, and, and the thing too, is like when we talk about this, that's an excellent question
[6908.16s -> 6908.42s]  too.
[6908.54s -> 6913.94s]  And I like to address, cause when we talk about fat max and fat oxidation, we're talking
[6913.94s -> 6917.44s]  about very, very, very small amounts of fat.
[6917.46s -> 6923.12s]  That someone oxidizes, you know, so we're talking about like, for example, if you're
[6923.12s -> 6930.82s]  a, um, uh, uh, an okay fit individual, your fat max is going to be 0.4 grams per minute
[6930.82s -> 6933.72s]  around that, you know, amount.
[6933.72s -> 6936.54s]  If you're a world-class athlete, we're talking about 0.8.
[6936.88s -> 6942.26s]  Uh, if you're a moderately, moderately healthy individual, your fat max is going to be about
[6942.26s -> 6944.74s]  0.3 grams per minute.
[6944.86s -> 6946.58s]  So you just do the math, right?
[6946.58s -> 6947.16s]  If you are.
[6947.46s -> 6954.72s]  If you're exercising, uh, 60 minutes at your fat max, and let's say you're 0.35, you're
[6954.72s -> 6957.68s]  actually losing 21 grams of fat.
[6957.88s -> 6958.62s]  That's it.
[6959.70s -> 6960.14s]  Right.
[6960.34s -> 6961.04s]  In one hour.
[6961.26s -> 6961.70s]  Right.
[6961.76s -> 6963.78s]  So there's no magic like, oh, wow.
[6963.82s -> 6964.06s]  Yeah.
[6964.20s -> 6966.78s]  I just, I just burned so much fat today.
[6966.98s -> 6968.58s]  No, it's not such a thing like that.
[6968.62s -> 6972.56s]  You know, you, you burn a little bit, but a little bit every day.
[6972.88s -> 6973.32s]  Right.
[6973.32s -> 6977.32s]  If you, if you then also match this with proper nutrition.
[6977.46s -> 6978.46s]  Right.
[6978.46s -> 6985.70s]  And, and, and stay, uh, at some caloric deficit, then yeah, those 21 grams of fat, right.
[6985.70s -> 6989.70s]  Times, uh, uh, if you do this five days a week, right.
[6989.70s -> 6993.70s]  Times, uh, four, uh, weeks per month.
[6993.70s -> 6994.70s]  Yeah.
[6994.70s -> 6995.70s]  Yeah.
[6995.70s -> 6996.70s]  That's half a kilo.
[6996.70s -> 6997.70s]  Right.
[6997.70s -> 6998.70s]  So that's half a kilo.
[6998.70s -> 6999.70s]  It's, it's not bad.
[6999.70s -> 7002.46s]  You put that in 12 months in that six kilos that you lose.
[7002.46s -> 7003.46s]  Right.
[7003.46s -> 7004.46s]  And that's, again, that's exercising one hour.
[7004.46s -> 7005.46s]  If you exercise an hour and a half, we're going to lose.
[7005.46s -> 7006.46s]  Right.
[7006.46s -> 7007.46s]  Yeah.
[7007.46s -> 7012.88s]  So you're talking about, uh, uh, nine kilos, which is, could be incredibly beneficial for
[7012.88s -> 7013.88s]  your health.
[7013.88s -> 7014.88s]  Right.
[7014.88s -> 7019.30s]  So this is what I think that there's no magic bullet that, oh, wow, you're, you're fat max.
[7019.30s -> 7024.70s]  People sometimes think, oh, I'm losing so much father for, I can have a burger, a cheesy
[7024.70s -> 7029.44s]  greasy burger because I exercise, you know, and that's the other thing too, of, of, of
[7029.44s -> 7035.46s]  many of these machines or even watches or so like, oh, you burn 700 calories today.
[7035.46s -> 7036.46s]  Yeah.
[7036.46s -> 7037.46s]  Right.
[7037.46s -> 7038.46s]  But they're not telling you the partitioning.
[7038.46s -> 7039.46s]  Right.
[7039.46s -> 7044.96s]  You, you, you could have burned a hundred percent of those 700 calories derived from carbohydrates
[7044.96s -> 7050.38s]  in zero from fat because your exercise mode or doses was not the right one.
[7050.38s -> 7051.38s]  Right.
[7051.38s -> 7054.80s]  Or you might have a 50 50 or 70 30.
[7054.80s -> 7057.58s]  So that's going to obviously impact, right.
[7057.58s -> 7061.16s]  How much progress you make when it comes to lose weight.
[7061.16s -> 7065.38s]  And this is one of the reasons why a lot of people who exercise regularly, they cannot
[7065.38s -> 7066.38s]  lose weight.
[7066.38s -> 7067.38s]  Right.
[7067.38s -> 7071.20s]  And, uh, because they say, man, I'm burning 700 calories or 1000 calories every time I
[7071.20s -> 7073.50s]  exercise and I can't lose weight.
[7073.50s -> 7079.44s]  Well, first you're, you're probably overeating, uh, for how much you burn.
[7079.44s -> 7084.46s]  And second, you're not burning much fat, if that at all, when you exercise.
[7084.46s -> 7092.26s]  So this is why it's, it's, it's a tricky concept and it's about patient patients also.
[7092.26s -> 7095.38s]  Doesn't it just come back to energy balance at the end of the day?
[7095.38s -> 7096.38s]  Yeah.
[7096.38s -> 7105.26s]  So in your, in your workout, if you burn or expend 400 calories from mostly fat versus
[7105.26s -> 7110.92s]  someone else who works out for a shorter duration, but also expense 400 calories, mostly from
[7110.92s -> 7119.30s]  glucose, isn't the net effect on their body weight going to be the same despite the difference
[7119.30s -> 7122.74s]  in substrates being used to produce energy?
[7122.74s -> 7124.38s]  I don't think necessarily.
[7124.38s -> 7125.38s]  That's my opinion.
[7125.38s -> 7130.62s]  Um, that there's like a, uh, there's energy balance is very important for sure, but it's
[7130.62s -> 7134.82s]  also an, um, energy efficiency and the type of substrate.
[7134.82s -> 7139.94s]  So if you want to lose fat, you want to burn more fat than glucose because that comes from
[7139.94s -> 7142.26s]  adipose tissue, right?
[7142.26s -> 7147.68s]  The thing is that, um, w w we're used to also seeing a lot of people doing high intensity
[7147.68s -> 7153.38s]  exercise, uh, and, uh, who already already very fit to start it with.
[7153.38s -> 7154.38s]  Right.
[7154.38s -> 7158.60s]  They have a good, probably because they, they, they, they, they haven't achieved a mitochondrial
[7158.60s -> 7164.38s]  decay because since they were kids, they've been fit and doing exercise and moving a lot.
[7164.38s -> 7165.38s]  Right.
[7165.38s -> 7170.00s]  Um, but, and, and they, you see these people doing this high intensity exercises and they're
[7170.00s -> 7173.00s]  very fit, uh, and they don't have much fat.
[7173.00s -> 7178.28s]  Uh, um, and, uh, yeah, that that's, uh, and then that's maybe the, the calorie balance
[7178.28s -> 7184.30s]  is more important for them, but maybe for people who, uh, are overweight or obese, uh,
[7184.38s -> 7191.10s]  um, uh, the energy balance should be more towards, uh, burning more fat and restricting
[7191.10s -> 7197.86s]  or so calories from your diet to achieve that valor, um, um, a calorie balance as well as
[7197.86s -> 7205.66s]  to improve mitochondrial efficiency through specific targeting of, uh, uh, training intensities.
[7205.66s -> 7211.52s]  I guess I'd always just looked at the, the kind of, uh, the, the dietary intervention
[7211.52s -> 7213.38s]  trials, looking at low carb diets.
[7213.38s -> 7214.38s]  Yeah.
[7214.38s -> 7219.26s]  That are high in fat versus high carb diets, low in fat.
[7219.26s -> 7224.14s]  And at least at the 12 month mark, and some of this could be adherence, there doesn't
[7224.14s -> 7228.06s]  seem to be a big difference in, in body fat.
[7228.06s -> 7233.20s]  And the way that I've reconciled that is that the people on the high fat diet, although
[7233.20s -> 7240.80s]  they're born burning more fat or oxidizing more fat, it's dietary fat, not necessarily
[7240.80s -> 7243.38s]  stored body fat.
[7243.38s -> 7244.38s]  Yeah.
[7244.38s -> 7248.80s]  That's, that's interesting for, for us, for me to kind of, um, think about further coming
[7248.80s -> 7251.56s]  back to, to, to zone two.
[7251.56s -> 7257.12s]  So you've got the talk test, um, being a little bit puffy, a little bit sweaty.
[7257.12s -> 7261.88s]  We spoke about those different formulas that are out there and it sounds like that if someone
[7261.88s -> 7266.92s]  is using any of those algorithms or formulas, they're, they're still going to want to come
[7266.92s -> 7272.14s]  back to the talk test and, and pair the two together.
[7272.14s -> 7273.14s]  Um.
[7273.38s -> 7281.20s]  I, I recently did a VO2 max test in a lab and through that VO2 max test, they calculated
[7281.20s -> 7282.20s]  my zones.
[7282.20s -> 7287.14s]  I know that's different to lactate testing per se.
[7287.14s -> 7291.18s]  I noted that there was, there's an upper and a lower bound.
[7291.18s -> 7298.26s]  So for me, zone two came out at 129 to 142 beats per minute.
[7298.26s -> 7302.38s]  Let's just pretend that it, that is my accurate zone two.
[7302.38s -> 7303.38s]  Okay.
[7303.38s -> 7307.34s]  I'd say that we need to do lactate testing to get very accurate.
[7307.34s -> 7315.50s]  But my question to you is when I am going out and doing zone two training sessions,
[7315.50s -> 7317.50s]  does it matter where I'm sitting in that range?
[7317.50s -> 7324.38s]  Do I need to get right up to 142 beats per minute at the upper sort of bound in order
[7324.38s -> 7329.20s]  to get the, the stimulus that we need to drive these adaptations?
[7329.20s -> 7330.20s]  Yeah.
[7330.20s -> 7331.90s]  That's a great question too.
[7331.90s -> 7333.20s]  And, and, and it's good that.
[7333.20s -> 7337.20s]  You have like relatively like a small range, right?
[7337.20s -> 7341.84s]  I've seen people getting a range of 30 beats per minute, you know, for zone two.
[7341.84s -> 7346.74s]  And I guarantee you that there's not such a big range, you know, we usually, the range
[7346.74s -> 7350.08s]  is somewhere between five and 10 beats per minute.
[7350.08s -> 7351.08s]  Right.
[7351.08s -> 7359.16s]  Um, um, at least with my calculations and, and, and how they work for me, um, but yeah,
[7359.16s -> 7360.16s]  absolutely.
[7360.16s -> 7363.16s]  Um, I think that you want to go more towards in the middle.
[7363.20s -> 7364.20s]  Right.
[7364.20s -> 7369.92s]  Uh, to be more conservative towards the high end, um, of zone two, that's when you're going
[7369.92s -> 7373.56s]  to push those, uh, bioenergetics the most right.
[7373.56s -> 7379.48s]  And, and driving to fat max before you start engaging more, uh, the, uh, fast twitch muscle
[7379.48s -> 7385.58s]  fibers and, and, and switching more towards increasing glucose as energy fuel.
[7385.58s -> 7390.60s]  Um, but, uh, but yeah, but you need to be very sure that the zone two is, is that zone
[7390.60s -> 7392.20s]  two, if you go in the high end.
[7392.20s -> 7395.78s]  Otherwise I would stay more in the middle.
[7395.78s -> 7405.36s]  So if we are dipping in and out of zone two, does that make that training session somewhat
[7405.36s -> 7409.86s]  redundant or diminish the sort of returns that you're going to get?
[7409.86s -> 7417.00s]  So if you're doing say 60 minutes on a stationary bike, but 45 minutes of that was zone two
[7417.00s -> 7421.20s]  sporadically throughout that session, you were dipping down back to zone one.
[7421.20s -> 7422.20s]  Right.
[7422.20s -> 7426.24s]  And once you were going into zone three, and this is something that I think people who
[7426.24s -> 7431.60s]  go out and do rucking or hiking face because they're going up and down hills is, is that
[7431.60s -> 7435.82s]  a problem if we're doing zone two training, do we really need to get into zone two and
[7435.82s -> 7438.50s]  then stay in that zone?
[7438.50s -> 7439.92s]  That's a great question too.
[7439.92s -> 7442.96s]  And I think that, um, and this is my humble opinion.
[7442.96s -> 7447.78s]  I think that it comes to the, uh, the timing that you spend at your zone two.
[7447.78s -> 7451.78s]  Um, and, and, and, and like, as you say, it's some people who are doing sporadically.
[7451.78s -> 7460.66s]  So once or threes on two, um, if they're only doing these for 45 minutes, um, maybe the
[7460.66s -> 7465.04s]  actual portion of zone two might be 30 minutes.
[7465.04s -> 7469.96s]  And what I have seen is that, um, and it's one of the three pillars that I see is one
[7469.96s -> 7474.02s]  to identify the training zones, the intensity, right?
[7474.02s -> 7479.16s]  Second is the, uh, frequency, how many days you do this.
[7479.16s -> 7480.82s]  And the third one is the, uh, the duration.
[7480.82s -> 7481.74s]  Right.
[7481.78s -> 7484.68s]  Of each, of each, uh, uh, session, right?
[7484.68s -> 7490.26s]  So I see great results with people when they reach around one hour, right?
[7490.26s -> 7496.84s]  So like, uh, if you do one hour, uh, purely a zone two, you're going to get good benefits,
[7496.84s -> 7501.76s]  but if you go and go a little bit of bottom and below, or, or even to zone four here and
[7501.76s -> 7505.98s]  there, yeah, you might want to have a longer session, which is an hour and a half, for
[7505.98s -> 7509.66s]  example, whereas those 30 minutes is like when you oscillate.
[7509.66s -> 7511.78s]  Uh, but the pure zone.
[7511.78s -> 7514.70s]  Two is in that one hour, right?
[7514.70s -> 7518.90s]  So, uh, that's where you have the stimulation within one session that that's kind of how
[7518.90s -> 7519.90s]  I see it.
[7519.90s -> 7522.80s]  And it also depends on your form and your peak.
[7522.80s -> 7528.18s]  Let's say that you do like a high intensity interval in the middle of the session and
[7528.18s -> 7529.86s]  you only do one hour.
[7529.86s -> 7534.34s]  So if you do a high intensity interval, you're going to have a lot of lactate and it's going
[7534.34s -> 7538.78s]  to be there for, uh, uh, it's going to be there for about 15 minutes.
[7538.78s -> 7540.78s]  And as we saw lactate, it's going to hit it.
[7540.78s -> 7541.78s]  Like policies.
[7541.78s -> 7545.10s]  It's going to inhibit my, um, transportation.
[7545.10s -> 7551.02s]  So you might lose about 10, 15 minutes of the session, which, uh, again, if you do an
[7551.02s -> 7552.88s]  hour and a half, it's no big deal.
[7552.88s -> 7557.54s]  Like I do that, you know, when, when I go on the bike, I do usually an hour and a half,
[7557.54s -> 7558.54s]  an hour and 45 minutes.
[7558.54s -> 7561.40s]  So I don't have much time, but that's enough for me.
[7561.40s -> 7566.90s]  But yeah, here and there, I, I, I do glycolytic, uh, intervals cause I love to do them and
[7566.90s -> 7567.90s]  I, they're good.
[7567.90s -> 7571.76s]  And, um, and now with, with, with applications like.
[7571.78s -> 7576.54s]  Strava, you want to see where you're fitting with the rest and they're dangerous, but anyways,
[7576.54s -> 7577.54s]  I see that.
[7577.54s -> 7582.72s]  Um, uh, I mean, I, and I love this, you know, the side of trying to compete leaders, uh,
[7582.72s -> 7583.72s]  with yourself.
[7583.72s -> 7584.72s]  Right.
[7584.72s -> 7589.14s]  But yeah, I do this for maybe seven, 10 minutes, like a zone for interval.
[7589.14s -> 7594.06s]  And then I'm in a relatively good form within 10 minutes, I'm going to go back to normal
[7594.06s -> 7595.06s]  level.
[7595.06s -> 7599.94s]  So yeah, I sacrifice, you know, 15 minutes out of my, an hour and 40 minutes.
[7599.94s -> 7600.94s]  So I'm good.
[7600.94s -> 7601.78s]  I'm still doing.
[7601.78s -> 7602.78s]  I'm still doing.
[7602.78s -> 7603.78s]  I'm still doing 20 minutes or so at zone two.
[7603.78s -> 7604.78s]  Right.
[7604.78s -> 7611.34s]  So, but yeah, I think it's about duration at zone two, um, that you can afford.
[7611.34s -> 7619.02s]  And ideally, ideally within a session that is consecutive minutes in zone two.
[7619.02s -> 7620.02s]  Yeah.
[7620.02s -> 7622.02s]  That, that, yes, that's, that's the thing.
[7622.02s -> 7623.02s]  Yeah.
[7623.02s -> 7627.86s]  And like if people do a lot of intervals in zone two and intervals in zone two intervals,
[7627.86s -> 7630.94s]  I mean, you're, you're, it's not going to be your zone two.
[7630.94s -> 7632.94s]  You're going to be recovering from the interval.
[7632.94s -> 7633.94s]  Right.
[7633.94s -> 7635.94s]  And you're going to be still going through a lot of glucose.
[7635.94s -> 7636.94s]  Right.
[7636.94s -> 7642.10s]  Um, so I think that again, like I like to, to, to have it more towards the end of the
[7642.10s -> 7647.14s]  session, or if you have like a good hour and a half hour, 40 minutes, you can have one
[7647.14s -> 7649.94s]  interval in the middle of the session or two hours.
[7649.94s -> 7653.94s]  And, uh, yeah, if you can allow any viewer moderate, moderately fit.
[7653.94s -> 7654.94s]  Yeah.
[7654.94s -> 7658.94s]  In 10 minutes on the downhill or so you can come down to like a zone two.
[7658.94s -> 7659.94s]  Right.
[7659.94s -> 7664.22s]  If you're not very fit and, uh, you want to do several intervals, you're going to be
[7664.22s -> 7665.22s]  up there.
[7665.22s -> 7668.98s]  It's going to be taking time to come back to zone two.
[7668.98s -> 7672.36s]  So in that case, you might want to do an interval towards the end.
[7672.36s -> 7673.36s]  Which is what I do.
[7673.36s -> 7679.18s]  So I tend to do 60 minutes of zone two on a stationary bike.
[7679.18s -> 7682.94s]  And then at the end of that session, not every session, but at least a couple of times a
[7682.94s -> 7687.94s]  week, I'll do a hit and get into zone four or five off the back of it.
[7687.94s -> 7688.94s]  And.
[7688.94s -> 7691.22s]  So treat the zone two as a warmup.
[7691.22s -> 7692.22s]  Yeah.
[7692.22s -> 7699.94s]  Um, in, in that, so in that session, so dose wise across a week, we've mentioned 150 minutes
[7699.94s -> 7705.50s]  a few times in this conversation is 150 minutes of zone two per week.
[7705.50s -> 7711.22s]  Is that the minimum dose that would be required to build healthy mitochondria?
[7711.22s -> 7713.54s]  I don't know.
[7713.54s -> 7717.22s]  I personally question those numbers.
[7717.22s -> 7718.22s]  Right.
[7718.22s -> 7724.36s]  I think, I think that we as humans and our health, we, we got in so low, right.
[7724.36s -> 7729.92s]  That, um, the recombinations of 150 minutes, you know, are in my, that's my opinion, you
[7729.92s -> 7733.04s]  know, they're, they're, they're probably not enough.
[7733.04s -> 7734.04s]  I would do more.
[7734.04s -> 7737.90s]  Um, and I think that more research is coming out, right.
[7737.90s -> 7743.50s]  That if you do more minutes, you know, your, your health is going to be better and your
[7743.50s -> 7747.50s]  longevity is going to be better beyond X amount of minutes, which I forgot.
[7747.50s -> 7753.80s]  How many now you're not going to see much benefit, but I think that, uh, 150 is kind
[7753.80s -> 7761.56s]  of borderline, uh, especially for, for people who want to, uh, delay many diseases and for
[7761.56s -> 7765.64s]  longevity 150 minutes, like, uh, at the end of the day.
[7765.64s -> 7771.14s]  Uh, yeah, it's just, if you do, I mean, yeah, it's, I don't think it's enough.
[7771.14s -> 7776.64s]  I think that some, some were more in the 300 to 400 minutes a week.
[7776.64s -> 7777.36s]  It's ideal.
[7777.50s -> 7778.50s]  Which is twice.
[7778.50s -> 7779.50s]  Yeah.
[7779.50s -> 7785.12s]  I think I've seen some research suggesting that there's continued benefits up to 10 hours
[7785.12s -> 7789.74s]  a week and maybe it's diminishing returns after that.
[7789.74s -> 7794.54s]  Maybe there's just not enough subjects doing more than 10 hours to get, to get a good amount
[7794.54s -> 7795.72s]  of, of data.
[7795.72s -> 7800.32s]  You mentioned 60 minutes in a session being perhaps ideal.
[7800.32s -> 7805.80s]  I know a number of people will be thinking, okay, let's say I do 300 minutes per week.
[7805.80s -> 7806.80s]  Yeah.
[7806.80s -> 7815.94s]  Can I, can I split that up into 10, 30 minute sessions, um, or does each session really
[7815.94s -> 7818.80s]  need to be at least 60 minutes in duration?
[7818.80s -> 7819.80s]  Yeah.
[7819.80s -> 7820.80s]  Yeah.
[7820.80s -> 7822.70s]  I think that it comes to, to your schedule, right?
[7822.70s -> 7828.28s]  If you can do that boom and get out of the way in my, in my opinion, doing it continuously,
[7828.28s -> 7831.30s]  it's better than to, uh, to break it apart.
[7831.30s -> 7833.68s]  Uh, but sometimes people, yeah.
[7833.68s -> 7835.80s]  And I, I have, uh, clients and patients.
[7835.80s -> 7836.80s]  All the time.
[7836.80s -> 7837.80s]  Right.
[7837.80s -> 7842.80s]  They, they ask me, Hey, I just don't have, I can do 30 minutes, uh, walking to work or,
[7842.80s -> 7847.30s]  or, or, uh, bridge walking or, or before work and then 30 minutes afterwards or something
[7847.30s -> 7848.30s]  like that.
[7848.30s -> 7849.30s]  Right.
[7849.30s -> 7850.30s]  If that's the case, it is what it is.
[7850.30s -> 7851.30s]  Right.
[7851.30s -> 7854.80s]  But I just want to go back to what you were saying real quick about the benefits.
[7854.80s -> 7857.72s]  Uh, cause it just came up to my mind.
[7857.72s -> 7864.80s]  I see people, uh, um, uh, who are in the late fifties, early sixties, who'd been for years,
[7864.80s -> 7869.30s]  uh, doing 150 minutes, uh, 200 struggling with time.
[7869.30s -> 7870.30s]  Right.
[7870.30s -> 7872.10s]  But maintaining being fit, right.
[7872.10s -> 7874.36s]  Because they're moderately active, right.
[7874.36s -> 7878.02s]  But being fit, but always struggling with work, family, et cetera.
[7878.02s -> 7884.16s]  And then they, they re they retire early earlier, uh, if they're like those who are lucky, right.
[7884.16s -> 7888.80s]  Or pre-retire or they, they work, you know, like 20 hours a week or part-time or something
[7888.80s -> 7889.80s]  like that.
[7889.80s -> 7894.80s]  And then they start exercising and training in a more serious way.
[7894.80s -> 7897.26s]  Uh, doing 10 hours a week, for example, right.
[7897.26s -> 7898.26s]  Or eight hours a week.
[7898.26s -> 7899.26s]  Right.
[7899.26s -> 7905.30s]  Uh, we're talking about 500 minutes, 600 minutes, and in one year, within one year, their metabolic,
[7905.30s -> 7910.06s]  uh, fitness increases dramatically, right.
[7910.06s -> 7914.62s]  Dermatocondrial function, their fat burning capacity, lactogenes capacity, and, and, and
[7914.62s -> 7920.90s]  then you see data in people in their sixties that, uh, it resembles the metabolic data
[7920.90s -> 7922.30s]  of people in their thirties.
[7922.30s -> 7923.30s]  Right.
[7923.30s -> 7924.30s]  So this, this is kind of.
[7924.30s -> 7930.64s]  Not as extreme as the example of the 81 year old person that I told you, but I see this
[7930.64s -> 7931.64s]  all the time.
[7931.64s -> 7936.72s]  And it's incredibly inspiring to see that you can get a metabolic fitness of someone
[7936.72s -> 7940.12s]  in their thirties when you're 65, right.
[7940.12s -> 7945.24s]  It's attainable for, for those ones who can afford the time, but also I think it speaks
[7945.24s -> 7952.76s]  a lot, uh, in the, in the, about that probably we need more minutes than 150 to, to be better,
[7952.76s -> 7953.76s]  you know, for longevity.
[7953.76s -> 7957.88s]  For metabolic health than 150 minutes, we can do better.
[7957.88s -> 7960.10s]  That's maybe the right way to put it.
[7960.10s -> 7961.10s]  Yeah.
[7961.10s -> 7969.52s]  I want to speak to you about the best modalities, um, that, that someone can use for their zone
[7969.52s -> 7970.52s]  two training.
[7970.52s -> 7974.34s]  And you, you've mentioned walking a few times here and you spoke about the hard side doing
[7974.34s -> 7977.60s]  150 minutes of walking per day.
[7977.60s -> 7982.10s]  I'm sure there are people thinking, well, I, I go for a walk every day, I walk down
[7982.10s -> 7983.60s]  to the shops.
[7983.60s -> 7989.32s]  So when it comes to walking, what sort of counts as zone two training and perhaps what
[7989.32s -> 7990.32s]  doesn't count?
[7990.32s -> 7993.34s]  So, yeah, that, that's a good point.
[7993.34s -> 7997.72s]  So I think that for, for most people, if, if the, if the exercise is walking, it's going
[7997.72s -> 7999.60s]  to be a breeze walk, right?
[7999.60s -> 8005.62s]  Like a slow walk might not be enough to recover or improve that decay.
[8005.62s -> 8010.70s]  You know, it might, it might be good to maintain, and this is what we see in blue zones and
[8010.70s -> 8012.98s]  areas in Europe, for example, in the Mediterranean.
[8012.98s -> 8013.48s]  Yeah.
[8013.60s -> 8015.16s]  In different countries, right.
[8015.16s -> 8020.44s]  Where people live longer and healthier than for example, here in the U S um, and they're
[8020.44s -> 8023.78s]  always walking to work, working to shop, right.
[8023.78s -> 8028.72s]  Or even we see in here in the U S in, in cities like New York, right in New York, uh, people
[8028.72s -> 8034.18s]  don't have big pickup trucks to go and buy food for two weeks, right.
[8034.18s -> 8040.38s]  People have to live in small apartments, small refrigerators, 85% of people in Manhattan,
[8040.38s -> 8042.72s]  for example, they don't even own a car.
[8042.72s -> 8047.94s]  So that means they have to walk all the time to the store, um, and keeps them walking,
[8047.94s -> 8048.94s]  you know?
[8048.94s -> 8053.76s]  And, and if, if, if, uh, before that you've been, uh, you've been exercising for years
[8053.76s -> 8060.84s]  that yet that walking alone might maintain, uh, or, or slow down the decay significantly.
[8060.84s -> 8061.92s]  Right.
[8061.92s -> 8065.66s]  But if you already have a decay and you want to improve it, the slow walking might not
[8065.66s -> 8067.16s]  do much for you.
[8067.16s -> 8070.68s]  Uh, you might want to do a breeze walk, right.
[8070.68s -> 8072.52s]  Um, and then eventually improve.
[8072.52s -> 8078.14s]  And you might end up maybe slow jogging and maybe a faster jogging or, or something like
[8078.14s -> 8083.14s]  that, you know, or, um, yeah, or if you're on the bike, you might start very easy on
[8083.14s -> 8084.14s]  the bike.
[8084.14s -> 8090.02s]  And, uh, but again, this talk test I was mentioning, I think they can guide a lot of people.
[8090.02s -> 8095.24s]  Ideally, ideally you want to go to a laboratory and get your specific training zones and wear
[8095.24s -> 8099.74s]  a heart rate monitor or something like that, or now this, this, this watches can give it
[8099.74s -> 8100.74s]  to you.
[8100.74s -> 8101.74s]  But ideally is that.
[8101.74s -> 8105.36s]  But if not the talk test, uh, can help you.
[8105.36s -> 8106.36s]  Yeah.
[8106.36s -> 8113.06s]  And you mentioned the, the blue zones there that gets me thinking about the enjoyment
[8113.06s -> 8115.24s]  that comes with the way that you're moving your body.
[8115.24s -> 8118.10s]  You spoke before also about consistency, right?
[8118.10s -> 8124.74s]  So we could overcomplicate this to the point where someone ends up choosing a form of exercise
[8124.74s -> 8131.36s]  that they hate because it gives them the best sort of time in zone two.
[8131.36s -> 8134.98s]  Um, but there is rocking this cycling that could be stationary.
[8134.98s -> 8135.98s]  It could be outdoors.
[8135.98s -> 8140.12s]  There's jogging that could be on a treadmill in a gym, or it could be outdoors.
[8140.12s -> 8144.36s]  There's swimming lapses, all of these different modalities.
[8144.36s -> 8149.98s]  And I guess enjoyment has to be a big part of this so that you keep showing up day in
[8149.98s -> 8150.98s]  day out.
[8150.98s -> 8151.98s]  Exactly.
[8151.98s -> 8154.98s]  And this was part of the sustainability that we're talking about.
[8154.98s -> 8155.98s]  Right.
[8155.98s -> 8158.98s]  And it depends on your fitness level that you have to start it with.
[8158.98s -> 8159.98s]  Yeah.
[8159.98s -> 8162.80s]  If you're on a very high fitness level, as the people we were talking about who do more
[8162.80s -> 8167.36s]  high intensity, right, and all kinds of exercise, that might be good.
[8167.36s -> 8172.50s]  But if you're someone who's been sedentary for 20 years, uh, maybe just walking around
[8172.50s -> 8175.50s]  the block, it's going to be quite tasking, right?
[8175.50s -> 8178.48s]  So then you don't want to take on jogging or swimming.
[8178.48s -> 8183.18s]  If you don't have good swimming technique, uh, swimming, it can be really, really hard
[8183.18s -> 8184.74s]  exercise for you.
[8184.74s -> 8185.74s]  Right.
[8185.74s -> 8186.74s]  Um, or, or cycling.
[8186.74s -> 8187.74s]  Yeah.
[8187.74s -> 8189.60s]  If you live in a mountain mountain zone.
[8189.60s -> 8190.60s]  Right.
[8190.60s -> 8194.16s]  And, and you haven't cycled in a long time and you're overweight or obese, probably not,
[8194.16s -> 8195.16s]  not, not your sport.
[8195.16s -> 8196.16s]  Right.
[8196.16s -> 8198.42s]  Um, but you might be doing a stationary bike.
[8198.42s -> 8203.20s]  So I think that it's important to, when you engage in an exercise program to know, as
[8203.20s -> 8205.32s]  you said very well, what do you enjoy?
[8205.32s -> 8207.02s]  What do you think is sustainable?
[8207.02s -> 8210.92s]  And also for that, you need to be, what, what fits me the most?
[8210.92s -> 8211.92s]  Is it running?
[8211.92s -> 8216.52s]  Is it, is it, uh, for my knees also, I have knee problems or someone might say, I have
[8216.52s -> 8217.52s]  knee problems.
[8217.52s -> 8218.52s]  So I cannot run.
[8218.52s -> 8219.52s]  Right.
[8219.52s -> 8223.08s]  Or, you know, but I prefer swimming because I used to be a swimmer, for example, a long
[8223.08s -> 8224.08s]  time ago in school.
[8224.08s -> 8225.08s]  So I have good technique.
[8225.08s -> 8226.08s]  I don't know.
[8226.08s -> 8230.76s]  So I think that it's important to fit the type of exercise and individualize it.
[8230.76s -> 8231.76s]  Yeah.
[8231.76s -> 8237.52s]  There's some really important takeaways here for people, one, you sort of emphasize the
[8237.52s -> 8243.90s]  importance of trying to get up to 300 to 400 minutes a week, ideally of, of zone two, which
[8243.90s -> 8247.52s]  is a bit above the kind of 150 minute recommendations.
[8247.52s -> 8249.52s]  Well, that's the lower end of the recommendation.
[8249.52s -> 8251.92s]  But if you're interested in that, I want you to go and visit the website, which is zone
[8251.92s -> 8252.44s]  two and so it's called zone two fitness training.
[8252.44s -> 8258.60s]  Anyway, and then this idea of, of the exercise you're doing, being relative to your baseline
[8258.60s -> 8259.90s]  fitness.
[8259.90s -> 8260.96s]  Yeah.
[8260.96s -> 8265.88s]  So the commonality among everyone that's doing his own two training is that the perceived
[8265.88s -> 8270.68s]  exertion is going to be same, the same, and you're going to be in that same position of
[8270.68s -> 8273.86s]  being able to have a conversation, but being a bit puffy.
[8273.86s -> 8277.64s]  It's just that the fitter person will be doing more work.
[8277.64s -> 8278.64s]  Yeah.
[8278.64s -> 8278.86s]  Yeah.
[8278.86s -> 8285.42s]  out jogging at a much faster pace or swimming laps much faster and someone else might be at
[8285.42s -> 8292.54s]  that same level of perceived exertion the same puffiness and the same ability to have a conversation
[8292.54s -> 8301.68s]  just taking a little stroll down to their shops and over time that talk test is still going to
[8301.68s -> 8306.06s]  be what you're going to use to guide your zone to but you're going to be able to do more and more
[8306.06s -> 8312.30s]  as you get more aerobically fit and the mitochondria are being upgraded so to speak
[8312.30s -> 8317.52s]  yeah i agree i agree and this is this is what we see with many with many people who start
[8317.52s -> 8322.50s]  exercising this is exactly what they tell you you know like wow i can go faster at the same
[8322.50s -> 8330.24s]  perceived effort right uh and i can talk like you know i can still talk before i at this i used to
[8330.24s -> 8336.04s]  go with my partner or whatever and i couldn't talk past this walking speed now i can still
[8336.04s -> 8341.90s]  can talk no problem right so that that those are the things that are important to keep in mind yeah
[8341.90s -> 8352.02s]  i regularly do resistance training for sort of 60 to 90 minutes and i wear a a whoop sort of
[8352.02s -> 8360.50s]  wearable fitness tracker and within that it it breaks down the time that you're in different
[8360.50s -> 8367.84s]  zones during your workout and something that i've observed is that during that 60 to 90 minute
[8367.84s -> 8376.84s]  resistance training session about 45 minutes of of that are are in zone two or tells me they're
[8376.84s -> 8385.12s]  in zone two would that count towards my weekly zone two target i don't think so i think that
[8385.12s -> 8390.48s]  what it picks up is like when you're recovering from lifting right uh it picks
[8390.48s -> 8397.32s]  up let's say your zones now you enter with the test that you did 129 to 140 right so it picks
[8397.32s -> 8403.60s]  up when you get there in between sets or intervals right boom yeah you might be in that zone right so
[8403.60s -> 8408.62s]  that's why yeah you might see the majority of the time actually you're in zone two but but it's a
[8408.62s -> 8414.88s]  recovery phase right uh it's not a metabolic phase where you're specifically stimulating that
[8414.88s -> 8420.06s]  mitochondria function right because yeah as you know like when you when you do resistance
[8420.06s -> 8420.46s]  resistance
[8420.48s -> 8427.50s]  exercise it's it's more the atp phosphocreatine uh system that you engage uh which is quite
[8427.50s -> 8433.62s]  tasking and then you need to replenish that atp and you do that usually by increasing glycolysis
[8433.62s -> 8439.30s]  um and and then uh one of the things that um that happens is like yeah it's just but obviously the
[8439.30s -> 8445.64s]  heart rate decreases and it might be be perceived by the the watch or the heart rate monitor that
[8445.64s -> 8450.30s]  you're in zone two simply by the fact that you're um um decreasing
[8450.48s -> 8455.58s]  resistance but i think that in my humble opinion that that um the resistance days obviously are
[8455.58s -> 8462.42s]  really important to do um uh but i think that is something that you need to isolate right so it's
[8462.42s -> 8467.82s]  okay this is my days for resistance training or i'm just going to isolate this session completely
[8467.82s -> 8473.58s]  from the rest or i'm going to do zone two as a warm-up for example and at the end i'm going to
[8473.58s -> 8480.36s]  do resistance training or i'm going to do resistance training in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon whatever but i think they need to be isolated
[8480.48s -> 8489.92s]  in a perfect world where would we position zone two training i know there's some discussion around
[8489.92s -> 8497.30s]  are you able to stress the mitochondria more if you're doing your zone two training in a
[8497.30s -> 8506.86s]  fasted state or perhaps you're following a high fat low carb diet are these strategies that would
[8506.86s -> 8510.46s]  allow you to increase fat oxidation and increase your blood pressure and increase your blood pressure
[8510.48s -> 8517.40s]  and sort of further stress um the mitochondria to get those adaptations that we're trying to
[8517.40s -> 8523.82s]  achieve or unlock possibly possibly i am i'm definitely open to that but i think we need to
[8523.82s -> 8532.78s]  be careful because when you tell people to fast and exercise it can be a double-edged sword right
[8532.78s -> 8539.98s]  where people can um overdo it and become catabolic so they really have to manage their intensity and
[8539.98s -> 8540.46s]  the frequency of their blood pressure and their blood pressure and their blood pressure and their
[8540.46s -> 8547.96s]  frequency very well but uh yeah it could stimulate mitochondrial uh fat oxidation although
[8547.96s -> 8554.76s]  yeah we we have to be careful with that i i think that uh the truly way to improve fat oxidation is
[8554.76s -> 8561.92s]  to improve mitochondrial function first rather than doing in a fasting state or restricting
[8561.92s -> 8567.94s]  carbohydrates uh there there are a lot of you know anecdotal data and even some scientific articles
[8567.94s -> 8570.44s]  showing how fast the mitochondria are and how fast the mitochondria are and how fast the mitochondria are
[8570.46s -> 8577.94s]  fasting increases fat oxidation in the laboratory right um well that that's an artifact in in my
[8577.94s -> 8584.28s]  my humble opinion from 30 years doing this testing because one of the things that happens if you are
[8584.28s -> 8589.98s]  fasted and or you you have you've been restricting carbohydrates you don't have much glycogen
[8589.98s -> 8596.14s]  so when you do this metabolic testing and people do now substrate utilization to see how much
[8596.14s -> 8600.44s]  carbohydrates and fat you do or your or even your rer then you see yeah you're not fasting
[8600.46s -> 8605.68s]  this person is burning more fat under this stage but yeah it's an artifact in many cases because
[8605.68s -> 8614.12s]  you know you don't have as many as much glycogen so you cannot burn or utilize as many as many
[8614.12s -> 8620.66s]  carbohydrates and then these uh metabolic cards function through what's called stoichiometric
[8620.66s -> 8628.34s]  equations right so in order to burn uh one gram of fat you need x amount of vo2 and you produce
[8628.34s -> 8630.44s]  x amount of co2 and the same thing happens with the metabolic cards so you need to burn
[8630.46s -> 8636.80s]  a lot of fat therefore these equations can we can be equivocal because if you don't have enough
[8636.80s -> 8644.24s]  glycogen you're not going to engage glycolysis so much therefore your co2 production is going to be
[8644.24s -> 8649.20s]  less also you're going to be producing less lactate and that's going to fool the machine
[8649.20s -> 8656.90s]  interpreting that oh boy he's not he's not or she's not burning so much uh uh carbohydrate
[8656.90s -> 8659.52s]  therefore must be burning a lot of fat
[8660.46s -> 8667.82s]  so uh it could be equivocal and then we we have seen that um yeah you know oh wow you've improved
[8667.82s -> 8673.74s]  your fat oxidation tremendously with this diet and blah blah and then uh two days later just in
[8673.74s -> 8681.34s]  two days that person goes to a normal carbohydrate diet and fat oxidation decreases half right and
[8681.34s -> 8687.32s]  and that doesn't mean that the mitochondria in two days all of a sudden whoa i am not burning
[8687.32s -> 8690.44s]  fat no it is that it's probably an artifact from the
[8690.46s -> 8698.94s]  from the test itself so if i wake up in the morning and make a big bowl of oats
[8698.94s -> 8706.52s]  rich in carbohydrates and have some banana in there and some other fruit and then i go and do
[8706.52s -> 8713.86s]  so i have a lot of carbohydrates on board and i go and do my zone 2 training session an hour
[8713.86s -> 8719.58s]  after that is that in any way going to impair that's that zone 2 session
[8720.46s -> 8724.86s]  it depends on how fit and how metabolically flexible you are i would say right if you're
[8725.66s -> 8732.78s]  normally flexible you should not impair much i'd still would allow 30 to 40 minutes right for those
[8732.78s -> 8739.82s]  carbohydrates to be metabolized and then be a or be a stored as glycogen right uh and then you can
[8740.46s -> 8746.86s]  burn more fat but uh but still you know the intensity is going to override that that hype
[8747.42s -> 8749.90s]  hyperglycemia uh so
[8750.46s -> 8757.18s]  uh one of the things that you do when you start exercising um is uh increased cortisol levels
[8757.82s -> 8763.34s]  as well and and catecholamines and those are important for lipolysis so you're going to bring
[8763.34s -> 8769.74s]  down more fat and that is going to overwrite uh in in many instances that the possible
[8770.94s -> 8773.98s]  slight hyperglycemia that you might have which by the way is also be
[8775.42s -> 8779.74s]  managed by insulin right and uh but there's there's a threshold
[8780.46s -> 8785.90s]  that we still don't know very well like uh it's called kind of the cortisol threshold because
[8785.90s -> 8794.38s]  cortisol is necessary for lipolysis right uh for breaking down the fat to use it but uh past x and
[8795.90s -> 8803.50s]  like uh exercise intensity cortisol is absolutely needed to uh break down glycogen for energy
[8804.14s -> 8810.22s]  right and in cortisol then it elicits vasoconstriction to the adipose tissue
[8810.46s -> 8816.22s]  and catecholamines and therefore shut down lipolysis so it's a paradox that it opens up
[8816.22s -> 8823.02s]  lipolysis but it also shuts it down right so but i think that in early exercise intensities i mean
[8823.02s -> 8828.62s]  low exercise intensities um you can override the effects of having a banana for example
[8829.26s -> 8837.26s]  are there any nutritional or supplementation recommendations that are evidence-based that can
[8837.26s -> 8839.90s]  help improve someone's zone 2 pace?
[8839.90s -> 8848.10s]  two pace or the adaptations that they derive from zone two training i i'm i'm not aware of
[8848.10s -> 8854.72s]  you know of uh science-based that i that at least i believe you know i think that the best way to
[8854.72s -> 8863.00s]  improve is exercise um but uh yeah that's that's that's that's what i think um yeah have you heard
[8863.00s -> 8872.84s]  of a compound called urolithin a i've seen some some marketing in just the recent months but maybe
[8872.84s -> 8878.82s]  over the last year or so and i quickly researched it ahead of today's conversation i really didn't
[8878.82s -> 8885.52s]  know much about it but it seems to be a compound that we or our bacteria in our gut naturally
[8885.52s -> 8890.64s]  produce from certain polyphenols found in berries and pomegranates etc
[8890.64s -> 8892.98s]  and i look at
[8893.00s -> 8900.08s]  up online some of the the sort of more popular brands and i won't mention brands here that are
[8900.08s -> 8908.98s]  promoting this product and you know some of the claims are that this postbiotic will energize
[8908.98s -> 8914.54s]  cells increase muscle strength that it's a molecule that will activate mitophagy which
[8914.54s -> 8919.54s]  we haven't spoken about but to my knowledge is kind of the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria
[8919.54s -> 8922.98s]  is do you have a view on your
[8923.00s -> 8928.90s]  urolithin a is that something that you've you've sort of looked at at all well not not not a whole
[8928.90s -> 8936.58s]  lot but i but i think like yeah it's just i i i i yeah i don't have much knowledge about it to tell
[8936.58s -> 8944.62s]  you but uh but i i'll be still uh i will doubt about the big benefits of of these supplements
[8944.62s -> 8951.78s]  right i i really yeah i i don't buy the whole idea that one supplement is going to really make
[8951.78s -> 8952.68s]  a difference in
[8953.00s -> 8959.58s]  in um mitochondrial function or or it's going to alter uh you know the epigenetics you know
[8959.58s -> 8967.18s]  like i i really i really i really doubt it you know um uh you know like there's like one recent
[8967.18s -> 8973.42s]  one that is now the the big deal although yeah i think it's it's now on the slope down that is uh
[8973.42s -> 8981.96s]  um um uh nmn right or nmr like uh yeah nicotinamine mononucleotide right which is a um
[8983.00s -> 8992.24s]  like a precursor of uh nh nad right uh because as as we age nad levels in the cells they tend to
[8992.24s -> 8999.00s]  decrease um and therefore the supplement uh is going it's a precursor for up nad and it's going
[8999.00s -> 9005.40s]  to increase and therefore the cellular function etc etc right um i don't know i i've seen people
[9005.40s -> 9012.30s]  seeing saying oh my gosh it's this i i am the strongest person in the world uh i i've been in
[9012.30s -> 9012.98s]  all the rules and i'm not going to be the strongest person in the world because i'm not going to be the
[9012.98s -> 9017.82s]  records. I feel amazingly strong. And one month or two months later, they don't tell you that
[9017.82s -> 9023.00s]  anymore, or six months later, right? So I think there's a lot of placebo involved in many of
[9023.00s -> 9029.38s]  these things. And in fact, we haven't published it because it's a small sample. But for cancer,
[9030.08s -> 9037.82s]  we have seen that NAD, for example, can accelerate glycolysis, because NAD,
[9037.82s -> 9047.48s]  it's a big part of the glycolytic pathway that is utilized by cancer cells, right? So we did
[9047.48s -> 9057.52s]  this experiment with mice, where we implanted aggressive tumors. It was like a triple negative
[9057.52s -> 9065.80s]  breast cancer tumor. And one group of mice, we gave them placebo, right? And the other one,
[9065.80s -> 9067.72s]  we gave them NMN.
[9067.82s -> 9077.68s]  And yeah, within 21 days, the growth of the tumor was 15% higher in the group with that
[9077.68s -> 9085.42s]  supplement, right? So I'll be cautious about this, because can that fuel tumor growth? If you have a
[9085.42s -> 9091.58s]  small tumor, can you feel with that? We don't know. I think we need evidence more. It's like
[9091.58s -> 9097.58s]  people taking also these longevity drugs to improve for mitochondrial function, to leave a
[9097.82s -> 9108.36s]  20 years longer or get rid of diabetes, right, which is rapamycin, right? So rapamycin, it's part
[9108.36s -> 9119.58s]  of a key pathway for cell growth and proliferation, right? And there are a lot of negative and positive
[9119.58s -> 9126.48s]  feedbacks in those pathways. And I always like to say, don't mess up with mother nature and biology
[9126.48s -> 9127.38s]  if you're healthy.
[9127.82s -> 9156.30s]  Right? Because what if you take in this supplement and this is going to dysregulate another one that is going to take to a complete dysregulation of that pathway and lead to a disease down the road? Like could be the case of NAD supplementation, right? Dysregulates even more, probably could do that. I'm not saying this because we need a lot of research on both sides, right? So yeah, I can, I can, yeah, I think that's a good point.
[9156.30s -> 9157.04s]  Yeah.
[9157.82s -> 9178.86s]  I think that we have to be careful with, with, with, with some of these supplements, which more and more are sophisticated and can get to, can really do biological actions more than just having like the typical vitamin C or, you know, or, or vitamin A or even D, right? I think that now some supplements can be very targeted, you know, specific.
[9179.86s -> 9186.86s]  Yeah, I'm glad that you flagged that. And it's a reminder to kind of remain cautious when new supplements.
[9187.82s -> 9217.80s]  Yeah, I'm glad that you flagged that. And it's a reminder to remain cautious when new supplements.
[9217.82s -> 9247.48s]  Yeah, I definitely think that exercise is definitely way much more powerful than any of these supplements or combos, right? And, and it's very healthy.
[9247.82s -> 9277.68s]  Yeah, I definitely think that exercise is definitely way much more powerful than any of these supplements or combos.
[9277.68s -> 9277.80s]  Yeah, I definitely think that exercise is definitely way much more powerful than any of these supplements or combos.
[9277.80s -> 9284.62s]  cycle and cellular growth that we might not want to touch if we're healthy you know because that
[9284.62s -> 9290.58s]  might might dysregulate the whole pathway or the pathways you know and and there's a lot of money
[9290.58s -> 9296.16s]  involved with this there's there's weak science there's science done with mice who tend to live
[9296.16s -> 9302.20s]  two years only and they say oh they live three three months more therefore could be 10 years
[9302.20s -> 9307.94s]  more for a human it's it's a different ballpark and i remember one of the supplements that came
[9307.94s -> 9315.54s]  out resveratrol right that uh it came out 30 years ago or something like that uh life right
[9315.54s -> 9320.82s]  because it was shown that mice who were taking resveratrol every day they would live longer and
[9320.82s -> 9325.42s]  therefore this is going to be the best or most important longevity that's when kind of the first
[9325.42s -> 9331.64s]  longevity supplements start to come out right now the people who were 50 years old
[9331.64s -> 9332.18s]  30 years old 50 years old 50 years old 50 years old 50 years old 50 years old 50 years old 50 years
[9332.18s -> 9337.86s]  30 years ago, taking resveratrol, they haven't lived 20, 30, 40 years more, I guarantee you,
[9338.26s -> 9344.22s]  right? And it faded away, you know, and like the same way that most supplements will fade away.
[9345.08s -> 9349.26s]  But exercise will continue. But again, that's what I was saying. If we could encapsulate
[9349.26s -> 9353.28s]  the benefits of exercise in a pill, yeah, that would be the most
[9353.28s -> 9356.36s]  sold drug ever in history. Everybody would jump.
[9356.36s -> 9365.80s]  Okay, to summarize things here for the listeners before we let them go, I think two of the most
[9365.80s -> 9372.64s]  important things that we've spoken about when it comes to metabolic health is firstly,
[9373.42s -> 9379.64s]  being good at converting chemical energy from our food into mechanical energy, which
[9379.64s -> 9386.34s]  requires healthy mitochondria. And the best stimulus for building healthy mitochondria
[9386.34s -> 9392.94s]  being this zone two training that we've spoken about and trying to get to sort of three to 400
[9392.94s -> 9399.06s]  minutes of that per week. And then another important part of metabolic health being
[9399.06s -> 9406.02s]  the storage of energy, particularly fat in the right place, which means storing fat subcutaneously
[9406.02s -> 9412.46s]  rather than sort of between or within organs, which comes back to partly someone's personal
[9412.46s -> 9416.20s]  fat threshold, but really will be achieved by
[9416.20s -> 9423.40s]  finding a way of eating that leaves you feeling satisfied, full without needing excessive calories
[9423.40s -> 9428.96s]  beyond your energy requirements so that you don't get into that state of energy toxicity.
[9431.08s -> 9439.90s]  And that the zone two training doesn't mean or shouldn't get in the way of other important forms
[9439.90s -> 9446.20s]  of training. So you still want some zone five, four, five high intensity work. We spoke about
[9446.20s -> 9452.20s]  how the two of those kind of work together to help you better clear lactate. And of course,
[9452.46s -> 9458.86s]  resistance training as well. Was there anything that we didn't discuss today,
[9458.86s -> 9463.66s]  or perhaps that we spoke about briefly that you kind of wanted to add to?
[9464.08s -> 9471.10s]  So no, I think you summarized things very well. You did a great job at summarizing everything
[9471.10s -> 9476.02s]  that we've been discussing too, and breaking down every single aspect of our podcast.
[9476.20s -> 9484.18s]  And I appreciate it. I just think that maybe just the thing I would add is like there's
[9484.18s -> 9491.68s]  a lot of hype around zone two that maybe people are getting like, because in our society,
[9491.86s -> 9497.82s]  how society is, people are taking things to the extremes. And that now for some people,
[9497.98s -> 9504.02s]  everything is zone two when it's not right. And believe me, I've been doing zone two for
[9504.24s -> 9505.82s]  30 years with my athletes.
[9506.20s -> 9509.44s]  and patients as well, but, uh, there are more than that. And as you said,
[9509.46s -> 9512.44s]  very well, you know, there are other intensities that are necessary to do.
[9513.04s -> 9514.62s]  And, uh, um, uh, all,
[9514.70s -> 9517.20s]  all the forms of exercise like resistance training, right.
[9517.24s -> 9521.78s]  That so-and-so is not a panacea of, of, of, of health and everything,
[9521.92s -> 9525.70s]  you know, it's a very important part, I think. And I, I believe it strongly.
[9526.52s -> 9529.34s]  Um, but, um, yeah, it's just like, we, we,
[9529.34s -> 9534.32s]  we have to still be on track that there are other things, you know,
[9534.32s -> 9536.60s]  that you can do. Um, it's like a nutrition.
[9536.74s -> 9541.34s]  We cannot say that one nutrition is the best and that's it. Uh, no,
[9541.38s -> 9544.16s]  I think that, you know, could be better than others. Right.
[9544.38s -> 9548.96s]  But I think that, um, yeah, we need to do things in moderation also.
[9549.44s -> 9553.80s]  We didn't discuss this, but it kind of comes to mind.
[9553.80s -> 9560.76s]  Now zone three and zone four are often considered or said to be no man's land
[9560.76s -> 9563.80s]  or junk volume. Um,
[9564.32s -> 9568.70s]  is that an oversimplification and do zone three and zone four have a place
[9568.70s -> 9573.54s]  within someone's cardiovascular training sort of regime?
[9574.08s -> 9578.86s]  I don't think so. I think that, uh, they both are going to be good zones.
[9578.96s -> 9582.16s]  Right. And, and again, it depends on how much time you have, you know,
[9582.16s -> 9586.38s]  for example, with my athletes, the, the world-class cyclists, for example,
[9586.38s -> 9591.42s]  that they train, you know, 22 to 27 hours a week. Right.
[9591.98s -> 9594.28s]  So they have a lot of sessions.
[9594.32s -> 9599.30s]  So it's on two, but they also have a lot of time they spend, uh,
[9599.30s -> 9600.54s]  not as much as on two, obviously,
[9600.64s -> 9605.32s]  but they spend sessions specifically as on four and even so three, right.
[9605.38s -> 9607.74s]  Uh, which are necessary also for,
[9607.90s -> 9610.78s]  for performance to improve those specialism for,
[9610.78s -> 9615.50s]  as we discussed those glycolytic pathways and the MCT force, um, uh,
[9615.50s -> 9620.42s]  for people who don't have more than, uh, five hours, six hours a week.
[9620.96s -> 9623.94s]  Um, you know, I, I, I would recommend,
[9624.32s -> 9629.00s]  uh, more to focus on the zone two and, uh, and, and on the zone four,
[9629.54s -> 9633.50s]  um, you know, either at the end of a zone two session,
[9634.02s -> 9637.88s]  or maybe dedicating, if you exercise four days a week, uh,
[9637.88s -> 9642.56s]  you can do another two days on your own or one day, uh, all out. Right. But, uh,
[9643.02s -> 9647.66s]  but I, I would maybe isolate those two points, those two zones on two,
[9647.66s -> 9650.60s]  and some four, I think they're quite important, uh,
[9650.60s -> 9652.76s]  one for the glycolytic capacity,
[9652.76s -> 9654.14s]  which is the two of them and the other one,
[9654.14s -> 9656.36s]  um, for more of the mitochondrial function.
[9657.50s -> 9661.58s]  This has been incredibly informative. Thank you so much. Um,
[9661.62s -> 9666.20s]  thank you for all of your work, your research, your contribution to,
[9666.20s -> 9669.20s]  to science. I think we'll have to get you back on to,
[9669.20s -> 9670.52s]  to continue the conversation.
[9670.52s -> 9675.50s]  I'm sure the community is going to come come back to me with a number
[9675.50s -> 9680.42s]  of, of questions. So perhaps next time I'm in Colorado, um,
[9680.76s -> 9682.52s]  I might actually be there later this year.
[9682.52s -> 9683.76s]  I have some friends that live at,
[9683.76s -> 9688.32s]  uh, in Boulder, so perhaps we could, uh, continue the conversation.
[9688.98s -> 9691.74s]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Let's meet whenever you're here. Let me know.
[9691.74s -> 9696.06s]  I'd be happy to, uh, to meet for lunch or coffee. Absolutely. And let me know.
[9696.54s -> 9701.52s]  And yeah, it's, it's, uh, thank you. Thank you for inviting me to your show, uh,
[9701.52s -> 9704.46s]  your podcast. I'm, uh, yeah, it's, it's been a pleasure.
[9704.88s -> 9708.52s]  And thank you also for your contributions, uh, uh,
[9708.54s -> 9712.98s]  because it is very important that people like you are, uh, really, uh,
[9712.98s -> 9716.22s]  sending the message, you know, and that, which is huge and really,
[9716.22s -> 9720.36s]  really important then from, you know, something that, uh,
[9720.42s -> 9724.82s]  scientists and clinicians are not great are doing that. Right. Uh,
[9724.86s -> 9728.98s]  but, uh, people like you, your, and with your science background, of course, uh,
[9729.00s -> 9732.42s]  your understanding and your, your research, it's, it's, it's important that,
[9732.84s -> 9737.40s]  that your contributions, uh, are, are, are well, well noted for sure.
[9737.78s -> 9738.62s]  Thank you.
[9738.96s -> 9742.70s]  There you have it friends. I hope you enjoyed this episode. If you did,
