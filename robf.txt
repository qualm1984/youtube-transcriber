[0.00s -> 8.46s]  Hi, I'm Rob Francis, and I'll just go through my background.
[8.46s -> 14.68s]  My career has been in technical SEO and product management, and I developed a passion for
[14.68s -> 20.24s]  breaking down silos, solving complex problems, and connecting disparate elements to create
[20.24s -> 24.64s]  holistic systems.
[24.64s -> 32.12s]  I'd say this has led me to transform how organizations manage and leverage their content, and then
[32.12s -> 41.28s]  also ensure that the right content is seen by customers and employees at the right time
[41.28s -> 44.96s]  so that they can solve their issues.
[44.96s -> 49.82s]  It's about creating that seamless content experience that drives value throughout the
[49.82s -> 53.42s]  entire organization.
[53.42s -> 54.62s]  I'd say my passion is empowerment.
[54.62s -> 60.80s]  It's about creating that holistic end-to-end view of the customer journey and its downstream
[60.80s -> 61.80s]  impacts.
[61.80s -> 71.32s]  Connecting these dots is a lot like Opinion's river concept, and that's what really resonates
[71.32s -> 72.32s]  with me.
[72.32s -> 84.30s]  So I led a project at VMware where we created a seamless content experience using the Salesforce
[84.30s -> 90.62s]  Serum Experience Cloud that was used by almost half a million customers, and also an internal
[90.62s -> 96.72s]  version of that, which was used by our internal support users, the technical support engineers,
[96.72s -> 99.06s]  for example.
[99.06s -> 104.52s]  We focused not just on the isolated events and interactions, but we stitched everything
[104.52s -> 112.92s]  together to try and track and optimize the entire support journey for both customers
[112.92s -> 114.08s]  and for our TSE support.
[114.08s -> 125.80s]  The project I led integrated AI technologies, improved the search functionality, created
[125.80s -> 137.18s]  new product pages, created automation in the authoring workflows in Salesforce Lightning,
[137.18s -> 141.26s]  and allowed TSEs to help customers faster and improve the customer's user experience.
[141.26s -> 142.26s]  So that's what I've done.
[142.26s -> 143.26s]  That's what I've done.
[143.26s -> 144.06s]  That's what I've done.
[144.08s -> 151.20s]  And as a result, we saw some significant improvements in self-service rates and overall
[151.20s -> 154.42s]  customer satisfaction.
[154.42s -> 159.68s]  And I would say this project allowed me to step outside my remit, I would say.
[159.68s -> 165.86s]  I didn't have to do it, but it allowed me to help others in the support organization
[165.86s -> 173.08s]  and in an operational capacity to help them with Salesforce configuration and reporting.
[173.08s -> 174.08s]  Yeah.
[174.08s -> 179.58s]  And it was this kind of thing that led me to get awards, VMware awards.
[179.58s -> 184.32s]  We had above and beyond and at our best awards.
[184.32s -> 193.70s]  So I won those a couple of times as a result of stepping outside my lane, in a way.
[193.70s -> 198.12s]  I feel that Opinium's vision of that interconnected content flow resonates deeply.
[198.12s -> 199.12s]  It's something that I've always wanted to do.
[199.12s -> 200.12s]  I've always wanted to do it.
[200.12s -> 201.12s]  I've always wanted to do it.
[201.12s -> 202.12s]  I've always wanted to do it.
[202.12s -> 203.12s]  I've always wanted to do it.
[203.12s -> 203.96s]  I've always wanted to do it.
[203.96s -> 208.62s]  It mirrors the challenges I've tackled and the solutions I've developed.
[208.62s -> 215.04s]  So I've seen firsthand how breaking those silos and creating that unified view of the
[215.04s -> 221.14s]  customer journey can transform that organization's ability to deliver value.
[221.14s -> 223.54s]  So it's not just about solving immediate problems.
[223.54s -> 230.16s]  It's creating that ripple effect of improvement throughout the entire customer lifecycle.
[230.16s -> 233.84s]  So there was a moment at VMware where I realized things were too silent.
[233.84s -> 241.78s]  And we had to break down these silos, especially to transition over more to KCS or knowledge
[241.78s -> 245.88s]  centered service methodology.
[245.88s -> 253.40s]  And this was a bit of a culture shift and it had to be driven forward by providing the
[253.40s -> 261.84s]  right reporting and the ease of use and collecting business requirements to improve that usability,
[261.84s -> 262.84s]  of course.
[262.84s -> 263.84s]  Yeah.
[263.84s -> 270.48s]  And it was also the case of the Salesforce Lightning back end so that it was easier to
[270.48s -> 277.94s]  create content and alter content and create some level of automation as well.
[277.94s -> 285.46s]  So yeah, I'd say this willingness to break down silos is the core of who I am.
[285.46s -> 291.96s]  And I just enjoy helping others and elevating others in the organization, because it always
[291.96s -> 293.52s]  comes back in a positive way.
[293.52s -> 293.64s]  Yeah.
[293.64s -> 301.96s]  find um so yeah there we have it so i i'm just excited about the possibility of bringing this
[301.96s -> 309.40s]  passion um to for solve breaking silos solving complex problems to to opinium and i'd love the
[309.40s -> 316.60s]  opportunity to discuss this further um if there was an opportunity and thank you for considering
[316.60s -> 325.88s]  my application
